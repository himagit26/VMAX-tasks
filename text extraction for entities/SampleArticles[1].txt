New Delhi, May 17Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said the Congress would run a bulldozer bomb over the Ram Temple if the Opposition INDIA bloc was voted to power.Addressing a poll rally in Uttar Pradesh's Barabanki, the PM said, "If elected, the Congress is planning to challenge the Supreme Court's order on the Ram Temple. It will eventually demolish the temple. If the SP-Congress comes to power, they will again send Ram Lalla to a tent, and a bulldozer will be rolled over the temple."Anti-quota approach: Jairam hits out at PMCongress general secretary Jairam Ramesh launched a counterattack on the PM. Citing the website of UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Jairam said, "The website features an article that raises objections to the policy of reservation. This anti-reservation approach is against the Constitution of BR Ambedkar. The RSS and BJP are against the Constitution and the INDIA bloc is fighting to save it." Reacting to the PM's bulldozer comment, Jairam said, "The outgoing PM today said the INDIA bloc should learn from Uttar Pradesh CM where to run the bulldozer. See how Yogi's bulldozer is against the reservation for SCs, STs and OBCs." He blamed the Congress for the Partition and said "if INDI partners are elected, they will give properties of people to those who launched vote jihad for them".PM Modi's reference was to recent remarks by Maria Alam, the niece of Congress veteran and former Law Minister Salman Khurshid, who, while campaigning for the INDIA bloc candidate in Farrukhabad, appealed for "vote jihad".Addressing rallies in Barabanki, Fatehpur and Hamirpur, the PM said nothing was more important to the SP and Congress than their vote banks."When the freedom struggle was going on and there were talks of dividing the nation, people used to ask if that was possible. But it was done. They did it. They can go to any extent," PM Modi said, attacking the Congress and accusing its INDIA ally SP of "bowing before appeasement"."SP-Congress will distribute benefits to those who are waging vote jihad for them," PM Modi said in Hamirpur, adding the INDI bloc had been "knocked out in the first four phases".Attacking the Congress for its policy on terrorism, the PM said, "The Congress used to nurture a group of separatists in Kashmir. Pakistan attacked our country. The Congress government gave them a clean chit. Who did these people accuse of terrorism? They fabricated a new lie in the name of saffron terrorism."

Jupinderjit Singh amp; Gurbaxpuri Khadoor Sahib, May 17 Smoke blankets the Delhi-Amritsar national highway as farmers boldly set wheat stubble ablaze on both sides. The haze thickens as one turns from Rayya town toward Jallupur Khera — the native village of pro-Khalistan activist and National Security Act (NSA) detainee in Dibrugarh Jail, Assam — Amritpal Singh. He is now contesting the Khadoor Sahib Lok Sabha constituency as an Independent candidate. Destination NDA: A milestone at Khadoor Sahib gurdwara. Despite the smoke, there seems to be no haze in the minds of voters in this belt of the constituency. At Nijjar village (not of slain Canadian pro-Khalistan leader Hardeep Nijjar), just short of Jallupur Khera, a large board on a gurdwara announces: "This village wholeheartedly supports Amritpal in the elections. Other parties should refrain from seeking votes here." Adjacent to the gurdwara, a wheat field has turned black after being set on fire to "cleanse" it of stubborn wheat stems for the next crop. However, caught in the cross-flames of this "cleansing" process is a mango tree. Its branches and leaves are badly burnt, and it won't bear fruit this season. That reminds one of the lingering question: Could innocents, especially the youth, once again become victims in the crossfire if Amritpal and his team gain prominence? Memories of Amritpal leading a weapon-wielding mob to Ajnala police station in February 2023 to free his supporters remain fresh. In that same month, he openly supported "Khalistan", asserting that Sikhs need not demand it from anyone. "No, it's not about Khalistan," says 72-year-old Surjit Singh of Gagdewal village, passing by on his bike. "The government has unfairly locked him up," he adds. "Here, everyone wants to vote for Amritpal, especially the youth. Although old folks like me may stick to our traditional choices — the Congress or Akalis — I can't say for sure. Perhaps I'll vote for him too." Jallupur Khera is a wealthy village with cement houses and no kucha kotha (poor house), although the main approach road is all stone and sand. A vehicle of an election observer makes a round of the village at slow speed trying to negotiate the sharp stones that threaten to stab his car tyres. Candidate Amritpal's election office operates from the house of his maternal uncle, Sukhchain Singh, a retired Punjab Police inspector. The office has less than 10 persons, who continue to belong mostly to the Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar), which is led by Sangrur MP Simranjit Singh Mann, a pro-Khalistan idealogue. Amritpal's parents, Tarsem Singh and mother Balwinder Kaur, were not at home or in the office when The Tribune reached the village; they are out, accompanying Mann for the filing of his nomination papers in Sangrur. Mann insists that "the narrative of Khalistan is wrong and spread by rivals." Sukhchain Singh brushes aside the talk of Khalistan with a smile. "It is a false narrative. Amritpal was only trying to cleanse the society of drugs. And he wanted the youth to become baptised Sikhs. I am a police officer. I abide by Indian law," he adds. Harmanjit Singh, an ex-serviceman and resident of the village, is part of Amritpal's campaign team. "I am an Indian soldier. We are not for separatism," he tells The Tribune. The comparison with Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, the former religious leader who held the state to ransom during the 1980s, is both inevitable but superficial. Political observers point out that a largely agrarian economy which is reaching the end of its tether in many ways is once again looking for deliverance. Amritpal's secessionist rhetoric is attractive, these observers admit, but empty. Former Director-General of Police SS Virk, who was in the forefront of countering terrorism in the 1980s, told The Tribune: "The state government will have to watch his activities. Earlier, Bhindranwale was allowed to grow out of proportion. The government has burnt its fingers once and that experience cannot be repeated. DGP, Intelligence, Rajinder Singh, who also has a great deal of experience of those years in Punjab, adds: "The pattern emerging with Amritpal contesting the elections needs careful watch. There is a crisis of leadership in the state. People in general are in favour of the rule of law. I hope the democratic process is not misused." Back in Khadoor Sahib, Sarbjit Singh, the sarpanch of Khanpur village near Baba Bakala, serves as the halqa incharge of the SAD-Amritsar faction. Previously associated with the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), he has now brought a local BJP leader — formerly the head of the Backward Class wing of the party — into Amritpal's campaign. Sarbjit's motivation is clear: "I want to fight against drug abuse. No party is addressing this issue because they have all become partners with smugglers. Only Amritpal is actively combating it." Khadoor Sahib's SAD candidate Virsa Singh Valtoha is most vocal about Amritpal. He, clearly, realises that if there is one candidate who will undercut his vote it is this Sikh candidate on the extreme right. "Amritpal only has supporters on social media. Many are supporting him from abroad or fake IDs," a derisive Valtoha tells this reporter. Amidst the heat and dust of the election campaign, the burning issues in the state, besides the ongoing struggle with drug addiction, is the release of Bandi Sikhs — Sikh political prisoners who were jailed because they once participated in terror activities, but have remained incarcerated for years without the glimmer of bail. Sukhchain emphasises this cause. Soon enough, the story accumulates a twist. The family of Gurdeep Singh Khera, a Bandi Sikh, opposes Amritpal. "He never visited our house. If he genuinely sought the release of Sikh prisoners, he should have started from our home," says Khera's wife, Gurjit Kaur. The dichotomy becomes even more pronounced at the Khadoor Sahib Gurdwara. A big flex poster of Amritpal hangs near the entry gates, like it does in a variety of other religious places and education institutions in the constituency. Inside the gurdwara, this reporter spotted a curious milestone, painted in white and saffron, which pointed to the National Defence Academy, 1857 km away in Pune. The gurdwara runs a military training institute and has recently started an IAS training institute. "Punjabis, of all caste and communities, have valour in their blood. What better than to serve the motherland in police and Army. The milestone is a constant reminder to our students about their aim. More than 20 have made it to the NDA, besides 600 males and females have joined the Punjab Police," Baba Sewa Singh said. The Hindu community remains wary. The agitation in Punjab, when pro-Khalistan terrorists targeted the Hindu community is 40 years old, but the inherited memories of those awful years keep them fresh. In Tarn Taran, "arhtiyas" or farming middlemen, say Amritpal is a threat to peace. Satish Kumar, Rakesh Kumar and Visvanath unequivocally tell The Tribune Amritpal's politics is "unacceptable in a civilised state". They will not vote for him, they add. "Moreover, he has no right to seek votes and he doesn't accept the Indian Constitution," say the three men. Herein lies the rub. Several political observers based in Chandigarh say that even though Amritpal's stated politics, in theory, is the demand for a separate state carved out of India, the fact that he is participating in the elections means that he has signed the oath to abide by the Indian Constitution. But a former senior police official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, was not so sanguine. "Hardliners have earlier too used elections in the country to suit their own purpose. They try to keep the separatist movement alive and radicalise some youths. Community elders should ask them to drop the demand of Khalistan if they are seeking votes," he said.
External affairs minister S Jaishankar, amidst his active involvement in election campaigns, emphasised the increasing importance of foreign policies in Indian elections. In an exclusive interview with Hindustan Times, he debunked the notion that foreign policy doesn't impact elections, highlighting the blurred line between foreign and domestic policies. Jaishankar noted that questions on foreign policy have become common during his campaign tours, reflecting a growing awareness among people. He attributed this to pride in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership and the understanding that global issues like pandemics and terrorism affect domestic life. Jaishankar also discussed his communication style, preferring town hall-type engagements where he interacts directly with the audience. He highlighted the youth's interest in India's global standing and shared anecdotes of diplomatic achievements, fostering a sense of nationalism among them. Dig deeper External affairs minister S Jaishankar (Hindustan Times) NCW Chairperson Rekha Sharma criticised Arvind Kejriwal's stance in the Swati Maliwal assault case, alleging that the Delhi CM is siding with his personal secretary, Bibhav Kumar, who is accused of assaulting Maliwal. Sharma asserted that Kejriwal's support for Kumar indicates his disregard for Maliwal's plight. The NCW has requested an Action Taken Report from the police, and FIR charges have been pressed against Kumar. Despite being summoned, Kumar did not respond, while Maliwal underwent a medical examination. Maliwal lodged an FIR against Kumar, accusing him of outraging her modesty and physical assault. Maliwal, addressing the difficult past days, broke her silence on the matter. The incident unfolded at the CM's residence in Civil Lines, Delhi, prompting police action and national attention.

To enjoy additional benefitsCONNECT WITH US Published - May 17, 2024 11:49 pm IST | Photo Credit: Godhashri Srinivasan/The Hindu On March 16, human rights activist Gautam Navlakha penned a letter, piecing together words of lament and surrendering to imminent arrest. Mr. Navlakha, is among the 16 human rights defenders who were arrested without trial in 2018 under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, for their alleged role in instigating caste violence at Bhima Koregaon. . In a letter published in The Caravan, he wrote he was “joining the ranks of thousands of others who are made to suffer for their convictions,” and dared to “hope to be freed” from “another conspiracy trial.”Mr. Navlakha walked free after four years of incarceration on May 14. The Supreme Court granted bail to the 70-year-old, noting that charges are yet to be framed, and the trial would take “years and years and years for its completion.” Six of Mr. Navlakha’s co-accused have been released on bail in the last six years: Sudha Bharadwaj, Anand Teltumbde, Vernon Gonsalves, Arun Ferreira, Varavara Rao and Shoma Sen. Activist Mahesh Raut secured bail in September last year but continues to remain in jail. Still behind bars are activists Rona Wilson and Sudhir Dhawale; lawyer Surendra Gadling; associate professor Hany Babu; activists and artists Sagar Gorkhe, Ramesh Gaichor and Jyoti Jagtap. Father Stan Swamy passed away while in detention in Mumbai’s Taloja Jail in July 2021, after being denied bail under medical grounds several times.The Hindu traces the legal developments, taking you through the deferrals and detentions that have come to define the fate of the 16 incarcerated.Mr. Navlakha was arrested on August 28, 2018, based on purported evidence of “involvement in inciting violence” during the Bhima Koregaon rally on December 31, 2017. The Pune police on the same day also arrested P. Varavara Rao, Sudha Bharadwaj, Arun Ferreira and Vernon Gonsalves. The Supreme Court directed that the accused be kept under house arrest; Justice D.Y. Chandrachud in his dissenting opinion cast doubt on “whether the Maharashtra police has...acted as fair and impartial investigating agency.” A local court granted the Maharashtra police’s appeal to transfer Mr. Navlakha to Pune, which was quashed later by the Delhi HC in October 2018. The Bombay HC in November ordered the police to refrain from taking coercive action against Mr. Navlakha. The activist, however, was subsequently imprisoned in the Taloja Jail in March 2020, after the SC refused anticipatory bail and directed him to surrender within three weeks before the National Investigation Agency (NIA). Two years later, Mr. Navlakha was shifted from the Taloja Jail into house arrest on the grounds of ill health and poor prison facilities. Mr. Navalkha requested a mosquito net (required under his medical treatment), a plea rebuffed by the prison authorities.The Bombay HC in December last year granted bail to Mr. Navlakha, observing there was no proof to back NIA’s claim that the activists had committed a terrorist act under the UAPA. The Court, however, stayed the implementation of the order for three weeks when NIA sought time to appeal against the bail order. On May 14, the SC said that “there is no need to extend the interim order of stay,” and ordered Mr. Navlakha to pay ₹20 lakh towards the expenses of the house arrest so far. Last month, Nagpur University professor Shoma Sen walked out of Byculla Jail after securing bail from the SC. She was arrested on June 6, 2018, by the Pune Police, along with Surendra Gadling, Sudhir Dhawale, Rona Wilson and Mahesh Raut under various sections of the UAPA and the Indian Penal Code. Among other charges, Dr. Sen was accused of “waging a war” against the government; inciting violence in the January 2018 gathering; having Maoist links; and harbouring fugitives and fundraising for them. Dr. Sen was suspended from her position in Nagpur University on June 15.Dr. Sen was lodged in Pune’s Yerwada Central Jail. The professor had applied for bail on October 15, 2018, on health grounds; she suffers from high blood pressure, arthritis, early onset of hyper glaucoma, among other ailments. The NIA was turned down a second bail plea on November 2, noting that the investigation revealed “material linking her involvement in alleged unlawful activities inimical to the country’s security.” The agency has not, however, provided evidence for this claim as yet.Dr. Sen challenged the UAPA charges in the Bombay HC in April 2021. She argued that NIA’s case was based onevidence retrieved from Rona Wilson’s electronic device, which was infiltrated with malware, as confirmed in a forensic report by Arsenal Consulting. She made another bail attempt in September 2021, citing susceptibility to Covid-19 due to pre-existing conditions; this was rejected. On April 5, the SC granted bail to Dr. Sen, finding no prima facie evidence against her and taking into account her age, ailments and six-year-long incarceration. Ms. Bharadwaj was arrested under UAPA on August 28, 2018, and has spent 15 months at Pune’s Yerawada jail and another year at Mumbai’s Byculla jail. The activist was granted default bail by the Bombay HC on December 1, 2021, under Section 167(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code and Section 43D(2) of the UAPA. The court noted that the Additional Sessions Judge who submitted the police’s chargesheet and extended her detention period was not authorised to do so. Per law, one is entitled to default bail if the investigating agency fails to file charges within a set period (90 days, in this case). The remaining accused had been denied default bail earlier.The NIA challenged the Bombay HC’s order; the appeal was dismissed by the SC on December 7. Ms. Bharadwaj walked out on bail on December 9, 2021. Along with Mr. Navlakha, Anand Teltumbde surrendered to the NIA in April 2020 for alleged membership of the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist) and his involvement in the Bhima Koregaon event. Mr. Teltumbde’s lawyer later argued that the activist was not present at the event, and did not make any provocative speech.The Dalit scholar filed three bail applications between September 2021 and March 2022. The first plea was on medical grounds — chronic asthma and cervical spondylitis, among other conditions— and was rejected by an NIA special court. The Court in December 2021 denied Mr. Teltumbde’s interim bail application to be with his mother, after the death of his brother Milind Teltumbde. The Bombay HC subsequently allowed Mr. Teltumbde to visit his mother on March 6, 2022, and asked the Maharashtra government to consider his health ailments. On March 31, Mr. Teltumbde filed a plea in the Bombay HC arguing that he was wrongly charged under the UAPA and that the NIA had not produced any charges of direct violence. He later approached the NIA’s special court, maintaining that the agency had not produced evidence of any involvement with the CPI (Maoist). Mr. Teltumbde remained lodged in the Taloja Prison. The Bombay HC granted bail to him on November 18, 2022, noting that the NIA’s charges of terrorism, conspiracy and unlawful activity were unfounded. Arun Ferreira was arrested on August 28, 2018, in connection with the Elgar Parishad violence and for links to the banned CPI (Maoist). The Bombay HC dismissed his bail application in October 2019; his default bail application in December 2021 was also rejected, along with seven other co-accused. A petition challenging this order was dismissed on May 4, 2022. Mr. Ferreira was lodged first in the Yerwada Central jail for more than a year, and then shifted to the Taloja Central Jail. The SC in July 2023 granted bail to Mr. Ferreira and co-accused Vernon Gonsalves, noting that “almost five years have elapsed” since their arrest and NIA’s “materials cannot justify the continued detention of the appellants pending the outcome of the case.”Mr. Gonsalves was arrested on August 28, 2021, and his default bail application was rejected by the Bombay HC in December that year. Along with his co-accused, Mr. Gonsalves made a representation to the SC-appointed Technical Committee to direct the NIA to hand over his phone after reports of Pegasus malware emerged. The activist appealed the Bombay HC’s rejection of his bail plea in the SC. A Bench of Justices Aniruddha Bose and Sudhanshu Dhulia granted bail to Mr. Gonsalves, noting that holding certain literature through which violent acts may be propagated would not attract the provisions of UAPA. The special NIA court has imposed additional conditions, directing both Mr. Gonsalves and Mr. Ferreira to furnish a personal recognizance (PR) bond of ₹50,000 each and to not speak to the media about the case.Mr. Rao was arrested on August 28, 2018, along with four co-accused. Mr. Rao received an interim bail on medical grounds on March 6, 2021; the Bombay HC noted his age, sickness and “serious” health ailments called for quality medical aid, and said that sending him back to Taloja Central Prison would violate his fundamental rights. Mr. Rao subsequently petitioned for permanent medical bail — a request denied by the Court, which directed the NIA to conduct an expeditious trial and review the condition of all prisons in Maharashtra. In December 2021, Mr. Rao’s default bail application was rejected by the Bombay HC. During his imprisonment, Mr. Rao tested positive for COVID-19; he was also admitted to a government hospital and found lying injured there. The 82-year-old has also shown signs of Parkinson’s disease. The NIA has opposed his bail pleas, claiming that Mr. Rao’s condition “was not very serious” and that he was taking “undue benefit of his situation.”Mr. Rao was awarded regular bail on medical grounds on August 10, 2022. The Supreme Court considered his age, medical conditions, and time in custody, adding that while the NIA had filed a charge sheet, charges were yet to be framed in the case.On June 6, 2018, Rona Wilson was arrested under the UAPA for spreading Maoist ideology, promoting enmity between caste groups and “waging war against the nation.” Two days later, the Pune Police said they had found a letter on Mr. Wilson’s laptop allegedly addressed to a Maoist militant and conspiring to assassinate Prime Minister Narendra Modi. An Arsenal Consulting investigation in 2021 found Mr. Wilson’s laptop was compromised with malware, and that incriminating evidence, including 30 documents, had been planted upon it. Mr. Wilson’s phone was further targeted using the Pegasus software, according to an Amnesty International report.Citing the Arsenal report, Mr. Wilson in February 2021 approached the Bombay HC to challenge his prosecution under the UAPA. The NIA has “stoutly” denied the Arsenal report.In September 2021, Mr. Wilson was granted a 14-day bail to attend his father’s funeral rites. The Bombay HC in December 2021 dismissed Mr. Wilson’s default bail plea, and in May 2022, dismissed a petition seeking review of its earlier order.For six years now, Mr. Wilson remains lodged in the Taloja Central Jail. Mr. Gadling was arrested on June 6, 2018, under the UAPA. The Pune Police accused Mr. Gadling of delivering hate speech that instigated the Bhima Koregaon violence and of distributing controversial pamphlets. Mr. Gadling was lodged in the Yerwada jail until January 30, 2019. He was named in another case of alleged unlawful activity in the Surjagad village; Mr. Gadling spent 12 days in solitary confinement before being sent to judicial custody. A special NIA court in July 2021 rejected Mr. Gadling’s interim bail application. He, however, received a temporary bail from the Bombay HC to attend his mother’s first death anniversary.An Arsenal Consulting report in July 2021 revealed that Mr. Gadling’s computer was also hacked and that incriminating documents were planted on it. The Bombay HC in May 2022 dismissed a petition that challenged a review of its earlier order rejecting bail to Mr. Gadling and seven other co-accused. Mr. Gadling received an interim bail in December 2023 to attend a relative’s marriage, and was required to furnish a PR bond of ₹1 lakh and two sureties of the same amount.As of May 2024, Mr. Gadling awaits trial.Mahesh Raut was arrested on June 6, 2018, for allegedly spreading Maoist ideology, recruiting Maoists and providing funds. In November 2019, the Pune Sessions court rejected a bail application by Mr. Raut and five others. In November 2021, NIA rejected another bail plea, claiming his name was found in a letter retrieved from Mr. Wilson’s computer. Investigations have disputed the existence of this letter, finding there was malware infiltration in Mr. Wilson’s electronic mail devices and that he was subjected to digital attacks since 2012.Mr. Raut approached an NIA special court in April 2022, challenging the claim of having handled money for CPI (Maoist), arguing that these claims too emerged from letters on Mr. Wilson’s computer, which was compromised. The Bombay HC on September 21 last year granted him bail on the grounds of parity, as some accused in the case were on bail. The court also allowed a stay on the order for one week to allow NIA to appeal to the SC. As of May 2024, Mr. Raut remains lodged in the Taloja Central Jail and awaits trial.Mr. Dhawale was arrested on June 6, 2018, under the UAPA. Mr. His speeches were found to be “provocative” according to Ravindra Sengaonkar, the then Additional Commissioner of Police, Pune. On September 5, 2019, a Pune Sessions Court rejected Mr. Dhawale’s bail application. The Bombay HC in December 2021 rejected the default bail plea by Mr. Dhawale and seven others. In April 2022, Mr. Dhawale approached an NIA special court with three others, challenging the charges framed against them. Mr. Dhawali contended the charge sheet was filed eight days after the event. “The court failed to appreciate the law regarding the grant of default bail as also effect of actions of the additional sessions court at Pune which lacked jurisdiction itself,” the plea said. Mr. Dhawale also added that his speech called for protecting democracy, and was protected under the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression.Mr. Dhawale remains in the Tajola Central Jail. The professor was arrested on July 18, 2020, for alleged Maoist activities. Mr. Babu was booked under the UAPA and for charges of criminal conspiracy. A special NIA court in February 2022 denied bail to Mr. Babu and three others co-accused in the case. Following this, Mr. Babu approached the Bombay HC, saying there was no evidence to suggest that he “supported activities to cause disaffection against India.” In late 2022, Mr. Babu also sought a temporary bail on health grounds, for treatment for abdominal pain and osteoarthritis in Mumbai.On May 3, days after Dr. Sen’s release and days before Mr. Navlakha’s bail, Mr. Babu withdrew his appeal challenging Bombay HC’s rejection of his bail application. His counsel said there has been a “change in circumstances” and they would return to the Court with a plea of parity with his co-accused who have won bail.Mr. Babu, lodged in Taloja jail for almost four years, awaits trial.Mr. Gaichor was arrested on September 7, 2020, under various sections of the IPC and UAPA. Mr. Gaichor, along with Sagar Gorkhe and Jyoti Jagtap, were organisers of the Elgar Parishad event under ‘Bhima Koregaon Shaurya Din Prerana Abhiyan’ on December 31, 2017. The three were arrested for harbouring Maoist links, for planning to “end Modi Raj in a Rajiv Gandhi-type incident,” and for engaging in acts that “threaten the unity, integrity, security and sovereignty of India,” the NIA said.In June 2021, Mr. Gaichor ran into trouble for writing a poem as a tribute to fellow activist Vira Sathidar who died of COVID-19. The Superintendent of Taloja Prison found the first two pages of the poem to be “objectionable.” Mr. Gaichor’s bail plea was denied by a special NIA court in February 2022. Mr. Gaichor, too, awaits trial. Anti-caste activist Sagar Gorkhe was arrested on September 7, 2020, under UAPA, for threatening to overthrow the government and assassinate PM Modi. Mr. Gorkhe’s bail plea, along with three others’, was rejected by a special NIA court on February 14, 2022. Mr. Gorkhe remains lodged at the Taloja central jail. In a letter dated May 20, 2022, he described the jail as a “torture camp”.The artist was arrested on September 8, 2020, in Pune. Ms. Jagtap was accused of singing and raising provocative slogans along with other KKM members at the Bhima Koregaon rally. The NIA submitted draft charges to a Mumbai special court 11 months later, claiming that Ms. Jagtap and her co-accused had links to the banned CPI (Maoist). According to the NIA, KKM is a front for the banned terror outfit. The agency claimed Ms. Jagtap wanted to establish a “janta sarkar” via “revolution supported by a commitment to protracted armed struggle to undermine and to seize power from the state.” Ms. Jagtap’s bail plea in October 2022 was rejected by the Bombay HC, which said that the NIA case against her was “prima facie true” and that she was part of a “larger conspiracy.” The artist approached the SC challenging this order, the hearing for which was adjourned on September 21, 2023. The bail plea was adjourned again in January this year, when a SC Bench said Ms. Jagtap’s application will be heard along with Dr. Sen’s case. Ms. Jagtap remains lodged at Mumbai’s Byculla jail.The NIA charged Father Stan Swamy under the UAPA, and for having ties to the banned CPI (Maoists). Reports alleged gross human rights violations, where the 84-year-old was denied basic facilities by prison and judicial staff. Father Swamy was suffering from Parkinson’s disease, had a significant loss of hearing, and was unable to walk, talk or do daily activities without support. The NIA denied his repeated requests for warm clothes, straw and sipper. The late Father Stan Swamy was arrested in October 2020, and died on July 5, 2021, while in judicial custody. He was at an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 while in jail, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention had warned. They added that Father Swamy’s detention was arbitrary, and his, death “utterly preventable.” In her book The Incarcerations, Alpha Shah wrote that “the BK case is a bellwether for the collapse of democracy”, and “exposes the brutal state-sponsored abuse of democratic rights taking place across India with complete impunity.” The Hindu Explains / laws / justice and rights / human rights BACK TO TOPTerms & conditions  |  Institutional SubscriberComments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

Asia is witnessing new tensions in land and sea as agreements were dishonoured and rule of law disregarded while terrorism has started to consume those who have long practised it, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Friday, amid China's military continuing posturing along the frontier in eastern Ladakh and Pakistan's support to cross-border terrorist activities. .live_stock #sr_widget .sr_desc #sr_widget .sr_desc .live_stock .lb-icon In an address at an event hosted by the CII, Jaishankar also talked about the power of currency and how "threat of sanctions" are deployed in the "toolbox" of global diplomacy, in remarks that came days after the US warned of punitive measures after India and Iran sealed a deal on the Chabahar port.Jaishankar extensively delved into the consequences of the Ukraine conflict, escalation of violence in West Asia and disruption of logistics in view of the geopolitical tensions, sanctions, incidents of drone attacks in the Red Sea and climate events."The world is experiencing a 3F crisis of fuel, food and fertilisers.

Azamgarh/Bhadohi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday accused the opposition of spreading lies and inciting violence over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, and said that the law is here to stay. Addressing a election rally in Azamgarh a day after the first set of citizenship certificates under the new law were issued, he dared the opposition parties to muster whatever forces they could against the CAA. .live_stock #sr_widget .sr_desc #sr_widget .sr_desc .live_stock .lb-icon They will never be able to scrap the law, he asserted, saying in Hindi, "Kya iss desh me ab tak koi mai ka lal paida hua hai jo CAA ko khatam kar sake?"These people are Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists. They have been living in the country for a long time as refugees and were victims of the partition of the country done on the basis of religion," he said.Modi addressed three more back-to-back election rallies in quick succession in Bhadohi, Jaunpur and Pratapgarh in Uttar Pradesh, targeting the Congress and the Samajwadi Party.Lok Sabha Elections#Elections With AllUttar PradeshMaharashtraTamil NaduWest BengalBiharKarnatakaAndhra PradeshTelanganaKeralaMadhya PradeshRajasthanDelhiOther StatesEnvironmental pollution in Delhi to be priority of INDIA bloc: Jairam Ramesh'Panje, Cycle Ke Sapne Toot Gaye Khatakhat Khatakhat…': PM Modi taunts INDIA bloc at Fatehpur rallyUnder Modi govt, implementation of Bundelkhand package plagued by 'rampant corruption': CongressWhat's in a nickname: Channi, Bittu, Pappi strike a chord with Punjab votersMore News >>In Bhadohi, where the two parties are backing a Trinamool Congress candidate as INDIA bloc partners, the prime minister accused them to trying out West Bengal's "TMC politics" in Uttar Pradesh. The brand, he claimed, represented politics of appeasement and harassment of Dalits and women.In Pratapgarh, he said the opposition INDIA bloc wants to appoint five prime ministers in five years and predicted that the alliance will disintegrate after June 4, when the Lok Sabha election results are out."Khata khat khata khat," he said in Hindi, suggesting that it will happen rapidly -- and also mocking Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for using the phrase to claim that a fixed stipend would flow into the accounts of poor women if his party comes to power.Modi accused the Congress and its allies of neglecting the refugees over the years because they were not part of their own "vote bank"."The Congress and the SP tried to spread lies in the name of CAA. They tried to push Uttar Pradesh and the entire country towards riots," he claimed."You are frauds... you forced the country to burn in the fire of communalism," he said, claiming he had "exposed" the opposition.He said voters in Kashmir felt proud to participate in the festival of democracy."The excitement shown by people of Srinagar in polls is proof that no one can bring back Article 370 and do vote bank politics.""Earlier during polls in Kashmir, there used to be protests, people used to fear for their lives and get threats from terrorists. But this time previous polling records were broken in Srinagar," the PM said.At the rallies, he listed development projects undertaken in the state and praised Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's handling of law and order."Terrorists accused of explosions were pardoned. Sleeper cells were given the cover of politics. Due to this attitude, terrorism rose across the country," Modi said, attacking to former CM Akhilesh Yadav whom he called SP's "shezade", or prince.The SP and Congress are two parties but have one "shop" where they sell appeasement, lies, dynastic politics and corruption, he charged."They have come with a triple dose of appeasement. They want to snatch the reservation granted to the SC, ST and OBC and give it to their vote bank. The INDI alliance wants to take half your property and give it to its vote bank. They want to divide the country's budget and allot 15 per cent of it for the minority," Modi said."We got the Ram temple after a wait of 500 years. The entire country is happy, every Indian living across the world is happy. But these 'parivarvadis' are hurling abuses. The 'shehzada' of the SP and his uncle call the Ram temple useless," he said.In Bhadohi, the PM lashed out at what he called were attempts to bring West Bengal's "Trinamool Congress politics" to Uttar Pradesh.The Congress and the SP are backing a TMC candidate in this parliamentary constituency. Modi called this a "political experiment", a trial of "TMC politics" in the state."TMC politics means murder of Hindus, harassment of Dalits and adivasis, atrocities on women. So many BJP leaders were killed there and TMC MLAs say that they will kill Hindus by drowning them in river Ganga," he said.The TMC politics included the "poisonous arrow of appeasement", calling Ram temple "impure", banning Ramnavami celebrations, sheltering Bangladeshi intruders and "vote jihad", he alleged, picking on a term used by an SP candidate."Why does the TMC abuse people going from UP and Bihar to Bengal. Babua, at least ask your bua (aunt) about it. After abusing them, she comes and seeks votes from the people of UP," he added, referring to TMC leader Mamata Banerjee,In Pratapgarh, the prime minister said the INDIA block sought to replace a stable government with one that will have five prime minister over five years."The Modi government will definitely be formed after June 4 but the INDI alliance will disintegrate 'khata khat khata khat'," he said, mocking Rahul Gandhi without taking his name."These people will run away 'khata khat khata khat' after the elections. Only we will remain. I guarantee that I will work day and night to serve you," he said.And, referring to Gandhi and Yadav, he said the "shehzade of Lucknow and Delhi" will leave for a vacation abroad.Running a country was not easy for people born with privileges, he said, taunting the Gandhi family over the loss of Amethi in the last election. "They have gone from Amethi and will go even from Rae Bareli," he said.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)

Amid escalating tensions in Asia, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar addressed the challenges posed by China’s military assertiveness and global diplomatic manoeuvres. He underscored the repercussions of dishonoured agreements and the erosion of the rule of law, emphasizing the interconnectedness of land and sea disputes.Highlighting the power dynamics of global diplomacy, Jaishankar discussed the implications of currency manipulation and the use of sanctions as diplomatic tools, particularly in light of recent developments regarding the Chabahar port deal. In an address at the CII Annual Business Meet, the minister also made a veiled reference to Pakistan, and noted the growing threat of terrorism and extremism, and their destabilizing effects on the region.Moreover, he delved into the broader geopolitical landscape, examining the ramifications of the Ukraine conflict, escalating violence in West Asia, and disruptions in logistics due to geopolitical tensions, sanctions, drone attacks, and climate events. He characterized the current situation as a “perfect storm,” emphasizing India’s role in mitigating its impact and fostering global stability.“The world is experiencing a 3F crisis of fuel, food and fertilisers. In Asia, new tensions have emerged in land and sea as agreements are dishonoured and rule of law disregarded,” he said at the annual general meeting of the industry body.“Terrorism and extremism have started to consume those who have long practised it. In many ways, we are actually going through the perfect storm,” he said.“For India, the task is to mitigate its impact on itself and contribute to stabilising the world to the extent possible. It is this judicious combination of ‘Bharat First’ and ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ that defines our image as ‘Vishwa Bandhu’,” he said.Focus on Latin America, Africa and West AsiaExpanding on India’s economic outlook, Jaishankar emphasized the need to diversify global resource access, particularly with emerging opportunities in Russia and Latin America.“An economy with India’s prospects also has to look at accessing global resources more seriously if we are to fuel our growth. For long, India has looked at Russia from a political or security perspective. As that country turns eastwards, fresh economic opportunities are presenting themselves. The spike in our trade and the new areas of cooperation should not be regarded as a temporary phenomenon.”The minister highlighted interest of India to expand numbers and volume with Latin America, Australia in addition to established ones like Indonesia, Africa and West Asia.Focus on ConnectivityHe highlighted India’s efforts to enhance connectivity, including projects like the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) and the India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway, underscoring their significance in shaping India’s future and influencing global dynamics.To the East, the minister said that the resumption of work on the India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway will provide India access all the way to the Pacific. “We are even examining the viability of polar routes, initially with the Chennai-Vladivostok corridor,” he added.The India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway stands as a testament to India’s commitment to enhancing regional connectivity. This ambitious project aims to establish a seamless road link between India, Myanmar, and Thailand, unlocking new avenues for trade, investment, and people-to-people exchanges. By facilitating smoother movement of goods and people, the highway not only fosters economic integration but also strengthens diplomatic ties among the participating nations.In addition to physical connectivity, India has also made significant strides in enhancing digital connectivity. The proliferation of digital technologies has revolutionized communication, commerce, and governance, bringing about a paradigm shift in how societies interact and operate. With initiatives like Digital India and BharatNet, India is bridging the digital divide and empowering millions with access to information, services, and opportunities.Moreover, India’s focus on innovation and entrepreneurship has fuelled the growth of vibrant startup ecosystems, further amplifying the country’s connectivity with the global economy. By nurturing a conducive environment for innovation and providing support to budding entrepreneurs, India is not only fostering domestic growth but also strengthening its linkages with the global innovation landscape.However, amidst these advancements, challenges remain. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in global supply chains, highlighting the need for greater resilience and diversification. As Jaishankar pointed out, the pandemic-induced disruptions underscored the importance of building resilient and reliable supply chains that can withstand unforeseen shocks.Furthermore, geopolitical tensions and conflicts have also underscored the need for connectivity initiatives that promote peace, stability, and mutual prosperity. In a world grappling with complex security challenges, connectivity can serve as a bridge for dialogue, cooperation, and conflict resolution, fostering greater understanding and collaboration among nations.

India now takes not just clear, but confident positions whether it be over the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the invasion of Gaza, or the South China sea, external affairs minister S Jaishankar has said. In an interview with R Sukumar and Shishir Gupta, Jaishankar said that the Modi government’s “experienced, sober, practical, grounded but courageous” leadership in foreign policy matters is now part of his pitch to voters, for whom he has a simple message: “Strengthen Narendra Modi’s hands because he is actually the guy who’s going to see you through the storm.” Edited excerpts: External affairs minister S Jaishankar (Hindustan Times) EAM S Jaishankar's 'gyan' dig at Western media over Indian elections: ‘Countries that go to court…’ Unlock exclusive access to the latest news on India's general elections, only on the HT App. Download Now! Download Now! We are in the midst of the 2024 general elections and the conventional wisdom says foreign policy does not impact the elections, which are more focussed on internal issues… I think two things have changed. One, the line between what is foreign policy and what is domestic policy has got blurred. So if you look at something like, (India) buying Russian oil, at the end of the day for the consumer, it is domestic policy, because it’s what you pay at the petrol pump. I find it very interesting, because when I have gone to about nine or 10 states during the elections, I almost invariably get a set of questions on foreign policy. So I think somewhere it has seeped into people’s consciousness. What has seeped into it? One, a sense of pride about where Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken the country. Two, an understanding that some danger outside, it could be a pandemic, it could be terrorism, will not stay outside, and will come home. So it’s very interesting. If you look at the BJP manifesto, I think we have given much more space to foreign policy than we have ever given before. Things in the external world are in a state of flux. We very much seem to be moving from one crisis to another. There’s Ukraine, there’s Gaza, there are terror strikes happening, somewhere there’s gunboat diplomacy. What is the way to manage this turbulence? You know, you actually said we are moving from one crisis to another; in truth, we are in multiple crises at the same time. And it began with one and then two, and then three. I mean, look, impact of Covid still remains. The Ukraine war is into its third year. Israel-Gaza, likely to intensify. Israel-Iran is still smouldering. Attacks, drone attacks, missile attacks which are impacting shipping in the Arabian Sea are very much a danger to Indian ships out there. Go further East, China trying to pressurise us in the LAC. Pakistan is in a perpetual, in fact, intensifying crisis. Afghanistan is getting very tense. Keep going further up to the South China Sea maritime disputes, then US-China competition, then Russia. Other regions have their own terrorism, governance issues. If one objectively assesses the state of the world, it’s actually very turbulent, very volatile with every prospect of it actually getting more complicated. So what can we do to respond? I think the most important thing we can do is actually have an experienced, sober, practical, grounded but courageous leadership which can take the calls because we will have to keep making calls. You know, we will have to make a call like we did, about our students in Ukraine. We will have to make a call, do we buy Russian oil. We will have to take a call, do we bend to Chinese pressure on Quad or stand up to Chinese pressure because we bent many years ago in 2007. So I think today, my message, when I go out, and people ask me… my honest answer to them is to strengthen Narendra Modi’s hands because he is actually the guy who’s going to see you through the stormy period; that you need a very firm, steady, experienced pair of hands on the tiller as we navigate these turbulent waters. And also a very clear idea of what our position is, right? I mean, what we stand for, what we want. Not just clear, I think very confident. I mean, a sense of what we are, what we were, what we should be, and how do I get to that? Since you mentioned Ukraine, what is the actual story behind the ‘Modi ji ne war rukva di papa?’ It’s become a meme of sorts. You are smiling. That’s because in this campaign, I would call it the number one FAQ for me. People are genuinely interested, genuinely curious; I’ve had functions from Odisha to Maharashtra, where students or families of students who came out of Ukraine wanted to come up to the stage to thank us for it. Shouldn’t take narrow view of Chabahar: Jaishankar after US warning on sanctions So, did the PM intervene? There are two episodes. The first episode was in Kharkiv. It was being subjected to artillery shelling. Now, to get them out, we had worked out a safe zone, where the students who leave Kharkiv City walk out there because there was no other mode of transport. Now, while this was under progress, shelling started again very close to the vicinity of the safe zone. So on that occasion, the Prime Minister spoke to President Putin, and specifically told him, ‘Look, this was an agreement between your people and our people, this is happening. So I would request you to personally have someone look into this and stop it’ -- which it did. It took a few hours, but the Russian shelling stopped and the buses went there to pick them up and brought them out. I think the other one happened a little bit later. Now the timing is important because what happened was, pretty much everybody else in Ukraine had got out or was getting out. And this one place was stuck. It was a particularly complicated place, because other than the Russian military and the Ukrainian military, there was also a kind of a Ukrainian militia which didn’t seem to be under anybody’s particular command and control. So everybody was firing at everybody else. And the students started getting more and more agitated because they felt everybody else was leaving. This is at Sumy? Sumy. So, we took two calls. One, that two of our very senior people, from MEA, who were actually handling this whole thing, were Russian speakers, we decided we would send them to Sumy. But the way out had to be secure. So, I requested the PM, saying that look, you will have to speak to Putin and Zelensky, which he was very willing to do and he actually spoke to both of them and told them ‘Look, this is very, very important, you know, we want your forces to stand down and give us a pathway and my officials will work out the details’. So, they passed the instructions down. I was actually sitting with the PM, and he called up Putin and Zelensky. In January, we were supposed to have a Quad summit, which has been put off. No future date has been set. Has the grouping taken a back seat? No, no, not at all. Look, I’ll tell you what happened in January. We ran into problems with every one of them. The Americans had a State of the Union problem. The Australians had their own national day on January 26. The Japanese were going through some political turbulence. And, frankly, that became a problem and once we missed the January window, we had to say, look, now Parliament is starting, we are moving into elections. But I don’t think it’s really had any material impact on the progress of Quad. That continues, everybody is very strongly committed to it. I can tell you as Quad ministers, we talk one-to-one or one-to-two or sometimes one-to-three, regularly. There is a Quad Sherpa meeting which on our side the foreign secretary does. So, things are moving well. Once the elections are over and the new government is formed, there will be things related to Quad which will immediately pick up. So Quad is in good shape, ready to do more. In fact, in many ways, I would say I find it very interesting that more and more countries actually want to work with Quad, even ASEAN, which initially had some reticence about it. Today, there’s a much greater enthusiasm about it. There are two schools of thought on the Pannun incident in the US. One was that the US in India would compartmentalise this problem and deal with it in isolation and everything else would continue. All the other work would continue. And the other one was that it would actually affect the relationship. Can you give us a sense of how the investigation committee’s work is going? Well, I agree with you that there are two schools of thought. One school of thought is Narendra Modi will never succeed and should never succeed. So there is a kind of professional pessimist school. Then there are practical guys like us who have a good sense of the world, whose job it is to deliver and we keep at whatever we are doing. In the case of the Pannun episode, the Americans brought to our attention certain data points. The data points were specific enough, serious enough for us to say, okay, it warrants us investigating it, because it wasn’t just the implication for them. We also in those data points, assess certain implications for us. So I think that is going on. But beyond that is there anything I would like to say in public? My answer is no. While we are on the Pannun issue, I want you to talk about the allegation that was made by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last year in the Canadian Parliament, where he virtually accused the Modi government of orchestrating the murder of Khalistan terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Now, they’ve already arrested people over there but there appears to be no evidence per se, right now, to link India. If I have an issue vis-a-vis country X, I would either go to that country and say, here is the evidence; now, please give me all your views on it. Or I will say I have investigated it and now come to a point where I think you have something to do with it, okay? In this case, actually, we see neither. You know, we have not been given anything specific to go on, which we can say becomes the basis for our own investigation... it’s now getting to a year from when Prime Minister Trudeau said what he did, but we are still very much at the level of suppositions, inferences and quotations. So no evidence has been produced? No, my answer to you is that I think there’s a political agenda at work. That today, he and presumably, I mean his political constellation, see some advantage in pointing fingers at us in creating a certain, I would say, narrative. And they think, I assume, that they will get some political advantage out of it. Now, I am also conscious of the fact that I think they are reliant on some other parties for support in Parliament and I think some leaders of those parties are also stoking the fire. So, frankly, in a way, I would say, the relationship has become a victim of Canadian coalition, compulsions, or political football, call it whatever. There is an election that is going on in Punjab, and if you start defaming India and talking about as if the leadership of the of the NDA and the BJP is involved in such an activity, the Sikh community within Punjab itself may sort of have a coloured image of what’s happening. Do you think there is an attempt to influence the election in Punjab itself? I think that’s a hypothesis which needs to be very carefully examined. What I can tell you is we’ve seen definitely, in terms of the Western media, a very strong attempt -- much stronger than previous elections -- to kind of shape the direction of choice in India. It’s almost like they are also a political participant in our democratic process. We know the realities today of the globalised politics. To some extent, we also know that there are people in the country who have made no secret of the fact that they rely on people outside the country to support them. So there is an in-and-out combo really at work, and it takes different forms. You attack institutions, you call into question the integrity of the value of the democratic process. It takes different forms. Look, I am a responsible minister, I am very careful about what I say in public. So at this moment, I will, I think it would be prudent of me, to stop at that. Okay. Customary question on Pakistan, we have only one. Prime Minister Modi said in a recent interview, that it sort of put a lock or a freeze on bilateral relations with Pakistan. That, by the way, is an improvement. There are many, many interviews where people don’t even ask me anything about Pakistan. As to my recollection, I think, essentially, what he said is, `Pakistan is no longer a reference point for me’. I am, I mean, in our business, we call it real de-hyphenation; my trajectory is up. Pakistan is in a different direction. My numbers look good and you know their numbers. I think the story is very clear. Well, I think what he was trying to say is yes, we have a neighbour, but that old habit in India, that you know, when are you going to talk to them, should we not be engaging them? That era is now behind us. We will assess them for what they are, and we will deal with them accordingly. On Wednesday, you went to the Election Commission to complain to them about Rahul Gandhi’s statement on the armed forces. Essentially, what he said, I’ll summarise it to you, is that Narendra Modi has created two categories of soldiers: one are the soldiers of the poor families, the backward to the minority families, and one are the children of rich families, and that we treat the two differently and if something happens to them, the benefits or the response of the military will be very different. Now this is incredibly dangerous, because you are now attacking the institution of the army. You are now saying that the army runs a two-track system, which is a downright lie. You know, I can understand politics but if you take politics to questioning you institutions, your security forces, you are doing great damage to this country. Coming to China, what is the situation right now on the LAC? The situation on the LAC is that both of us today remain forward deployed, which means we are deployed well ahead of our traditional bases and camps. Secondly, we are deployed in very much larger numbers than we deployed before 2020s. We are also deployed with very much more weaponry than we were deployed before 2020s. They did it first, we responded to it, so they are responsible for it. In terms of the issue today what we are discussing, right now the focus is on patrolling. You know, both of us used to patrol from our traditional bases to the LAC and there was like a patrolling pattern. The patrolling patterns have got disrupted. So, right now, the focus is on how do we get the patrolling issues resolved. Thereafter, there could be a discussion about the troops, weapons…that's the de-escalation side. But, we feel, first, the patrolling issue needs to be resolved. Some of the INDIA bloc leaders have been talking about the model village China is building in Arunachal Pradesh, nibbling of territory in east Ladakh, and also how our presence in Siachen is being threatened by road that is being by the Chinese in the Shaksgam valley which has been illegally sealed by Pakistan.You are an expert on China and you have served in China as an ambassador. Can you tell us in detail what is happening? Model village – are the Chinese building these model villages? Yes. The village which became subject of controversy, it is in a place called Longju. If you check the records of the Indian Parliament or you read any book on our border problem with China, the Chinese captured Longju in 1959, then there was a discussion with them. The Chinese came back in 1962; this time they captured it in its entirety and held it. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru in 1959 told Parliament, I am sorry but it has gone out of my hands. The second example which they cited was a bridge. There is a bridge which is being constructed on the northern side of the Pangong Tso lake. You can look at the coordinates of that bridge, it is close to a place called Khurnak, Khurnak Fort. The Chinese came to Khurnak Fort in 1958 and that particular part of Pangong Tso, that segment, they actually illegally occupied it in the 1962 war. The recent one which came out during the campaign; their spokesperson said under Modi, we are actually now even risking Siachen because a road is built out of Shaksgam valley which has implications for the security of Siachen. Now Shaksgam valley; in 1949, Jawaharlal Nehru allowed it to become part of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir by accepting a ceasefire and not pressing our attack on Pakistan further. Then in 1963, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto as the foreign minister did an agreement with the Chinese and handed over 5,180 sq km of that territory to the Chinese. Nehru let it happen, Bhutto handed it over to the Chinese and now you are saying Modi has culpability. The Congress party has actually been practising a very sort of clever doublespeak. On the one hand, Rahul Gandhi will actually meet the Chinese ambassador secretly while Doklam is going on. On the other hand, they claim to be a great nationalist outside. Please read Rahul Gandhi’s speeches on China, because he has a sense he knows a lot, and maybe he does. He doesn’t attack the Belt & Road [Initiative]. Belt & Road violates our sovereignty but the Congress party is very, very cautious about it. You can actually sense his admiration for China – you know a great civilisation coming back, a great manufacturing power. One of the things that India has sought to do over the last few years is emerge as an alternative to China in global supply chains or as a complement to China; the China plus one strategy with many countries in the Western world wanting to diversify out of China, not put all their eggs in one basket. Is China blocking this actively process in some way? I am asking this with the specific focus on what happened with Tesla. No. To the best of my knowledge, there is no connection at all between Tesla and supply chains at all. Look, what is happening with supply chains is, that there are two broad drivers. One is the manufacturing technology dependence on that over-concentration which China managed to get with the complicity of many Western countries and companies. People woke up to it during Covid. There will be economic de-riskers and there will be political de-riskers. The response is really today to multiply the supply chains, to get more resilient, redundant supply chain. To create more centres of production. The second is in the digital domain, a digital commodity, a product or service is not the same as a manufactured good. India today can score big in both; in fact, one of the initiatives of the Modi government has been a domain like semiconductors which is so important, you know. I mean today, in a way, chips will determine economic growth and even balance of power in many aspects; it’s a world of AI and it’s all about chips. Now, we have got left way way behind because you’ve had people in charge of this country who were also anti-manufacturing. If you do not do manufacturing, you do not get that employment numbers; you will not get technology. I mean, nobody builds technology on services, you need manufacturing to build technology, okay? So, I think today it’s absolutely vital for us to look at these new domains. Tesla has nothing to do with any of this. Tesla already has a longstanding business in China. So, I assume that, that guy was going to negotiate the past, present and future of his business (Tesla CEO Elon Musk made a recent visit to China), that’s the best information I have. What he was discussing with us was a new business. It’s not an either-or for him. It’s not that he is moving his China factory to India or by going to China, he is not going to work with India. This is a business decision, there is no political implication involved. You look at existing investments with one lens and you look at new decision with another. Don’t confuse the two lenses. Jaishankar's veiled dig at Nehru over control of Pak-occupied Kashmir: ‘Someone's weakness’ Moving on to the elections. In some ways, it’s your first general elections. Yes, sure, as a politician. Seen many as a voter. How was it to actively campaign in these elections, how was it to speak to voters? What’s your biggest learning? I was active in two of the state elections, the Gujarat state elections and the Karnataka state elections, but still, I must say, national elections/general elections are clearly different. Different people have different styles of communication. If you look at somebody like Prime Minister Modi, home minister Amit Shah, some of these people are, extraordinarily effective in mass communication. I find I am much more comfortable and much more effective in doing more of a town hall kind of thing. Sure, town halls can be pretty big. I did one in Mumbai, a day before yesterday, there must have been about 2,000 people. I am sure that in these town halls especially, there must have been a lot of young people. I am particularly curious to know what kind of questions they are asking about India’s role in the world? Since I became a minister, I have actually spent a lot of my time talking to young people. So, in that sense, a lot of their concerns and interests have been absorbed over the last five years. I find young people are actually very, very taken with what they believe is greater respect today for India at the world stage. They are fascinated. You have no idea how many times this Ukraine issue has come up. And sometimes, I actually talk to them about other operations. You know we did a very risky operation in Sudan. Our embassy was actually physically occupied by one of the combatant sides. I tell them how for example we organised oxygen supply, the kind of effort we made abroad or how you know there was a time when the US had put a ban on any vaccine ingredients going out…, how we persuaded the US. I think it’s good to see that sense of nationalism in young people because often when I travel out, my peer group ministers, they don’t have that same degree of optimism in their societies. The Prime Minister says he has a 100-day plan. What’s the MEA got lined up? Well, I think, it’s our job right now to come up with certain options. That’s the way Prime Minster Modi works. So, we are working right now in looking at a whole range of options. Obviously, we will have to wait and see, the government will form and once the government forms, there will be a method by which, these will be put forward to the prime minister and the senior members of the government and then we will take it out further. But right now, I won’t talk about the options we are looking at.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday launched a campaign blitz in the electoral battleground of eastern Uttar Pradesh, accusing the Opposition of spreading lies on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and of abusing north Indians to gain votes in the south, and alleging that the INDIA bloc will disintegrate after the election results.

In four packed rallies in Azamgarh, Jaunpur, Bhadohi and Pratapgarh, Modi also alleged that the Congress and the Samajwadi Party (SP) had brought in a triple-dose of appeasement, contrasting their alleged approach to the Bharatiya Janata Party’s record of working for the “santushti” (satisfaction) of all, in line with his mantra of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas (inclusive development for all). “Do whatever you want to, but you will never be able to remove CAA,” Modi said in Lalganj in Azamgarh, a day after the first set of citizenship certificates under the Citizenship (Amendment) Act was issued to 300 people. “These people say that when Modi goes, CAA will also go. Is there anyone in the country who can end the CAA?” Modi said, alleging that the Congress and SP made Hindus and Muslims fight. “But we have unmasked them. This is the Modi ki guarantee,” he asserted. “The work of giving citizenship under CAA to refugees has already started. All these people are Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists. They have been living in the country for a long time as refugees and were victims of the partition of the country done based on religion,” he said. Modi accused the Congress of neglecting these refugees. “The Congress and the SP tried to spread lies in the name of CAA. They tried to push Uttar Pradesh and the entire country towards riots,” he alleged. Former chief minister of Madhya Pradesh and Congress leader Digvijay Singh said, “Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s record of speaking lies remains unbroken.” Modi’s comments came as the focus shifted to the eastern part of UP, which goes to the polls in the fifth, sixth and seventh phases of the ongoing general elections. Of the 41 Lok Sabha seats in this region, the BJP holds 32, the Samajwadi Party holds none, the Bahujan Samaj Party holds 6, and the Congress holds 1, and the BJP ally Apna Dal holds 2. Modi further said the Congress and SP were two parties but ran one shop where they sell appeasement, lies, dynasty politics and corruption. “They have come with a triple dose of appeasement. They want to snatch the reservation granted to the SCs, STs and OBCs and give it to their vote bank. The INDI alliance wants to take half your property and give it to its vote bank. Also, they want to divide the country’s budget. We have to be cautious of those who divide and rule. They did Hindu-Muslim for 70 years. We must unite,” Modi said Alleging that the SP was running a mission to abuse the Ram temple, he said, “Our faith is being hurt for the sake of vote bank.” PM Modi reveals plan for money seized by ED in corruption cases, says… “We got the Ram temple after a wait of 500 years. The entire country is happy, every Indian living across the world is happy but these ‘parivarvadis’ are hurling abuses. The shehzade [prince] of SP and his uncle call the Ram temple useless,” he said. He was referring to SP’s chief national general secretary Ram Gopal Yadav’s comments calling the Ram Mandir “bekaar (useless)” as it has not been properly constructed, keeping the “vastu” in mind. Modi also referred to the high turnout in Jammu & Kashmir and linked it to the scrapping of Article 370. “In the recent polling held in Kashmir, people voted and felt proud of participating in the festival of democracy. The excitement shown by the people of Srinagar in polls is proof no one can bring back Article 370 and do vote bank politics.... Earlier during the polls in Kashmir, there used to be protests, people used to fear for their lives and get threats from terrorists. But this time, previous polling records were broken in Srinagar,” he said. “The fourth phase of voting in Srinagar marked a celebration of India’s democracy and Constitution after 40 years. The enthusiasm witnessed in Srinagar signals an end to vote-bank politics centred around Article 370,” he added. The Srinagar parliamentary constituency, which went to polls on May 13, recorded a voter turnout of 38% — the highest turnout in the constituency since the 1996 general elections when it was 40.9%. He said earlier people used to think of Azamgarh every time a blast took place but added the identity changed a decade ago. “Terrorists accused of explosions were pardoned. Sleeper cells were given the cover of politics. Due to this attitude, terrorism rose across the country. These people still have the same attitude,” Modi said. He appealed to the people to elect his party candidates Neelam Sonkar from Lalganj, who is facing SP’s Daroga Saroj, and Dinesh Lal Yadav “Nirahua” from Azamgarh, who is running opposite SP’s Dharmendra Yadav and BSP’s Mashood Ahmed. He highlighted the BJP’s reverence for the Yadav community and brought up Mohan Yadav’s appointment as the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh last year. Emphasising the significance of India’s global stature, Modi said, “The world is witnessing widespread support for the BJP, NDA, and their allies, evident in the unified voice echoing across the nation with the resounding chant of “Phir Ek Baar Modi Sarkar’.” Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Uttar Pradesh ministers Surya Pratap Shahi, Dara Singh Chauhan, Om Prakash Rajbhar, Lalganj MP Sangeeta Azad, BJP state general secretary Govind Narayan Shukla, legislative council member Vijay Bahadur Pathak, BJP candidate from Lalganj Neelam Sonkar, and Azamgarh candidate Dinesh Lal Yadav “Nirahua” were present at the rally. In Jaunpur, Modi said that the Lok Sabha elections was an opportunity for the country to choose a leader who could run a strong government which “makes the world aware of India’s strength”. Modi was addressing a rally organised in support of BJP candidates Kripashankar Singh from Jaunpur and BP Saroj from Machhlishahr. Attacking SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, Modi said, “SP’s shehzade also makes fun of Kashi. They are crossing every limit to please their vote bank. I am surprised that it is the 21st century and they are roaming around with the flag of triple talaq. Referring to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s oft-repeated comment that the Congress will conduct an “X-ray of India” through the caste census, Modi added: “You must have heard that these Congressmen brought an X-ray machine. One needs to be careful with it. I have been exposing their agenda for a week. It seems that their X-ray machine has broken down.” In Bhadohi, Modi said the Samajwadi Party and the Congress wanted to try out the “Trinamool politics”, terming it a politics of appeasement and harassment of Dalits and women. The Opposition has fielded a Trinamool Congress (TMC) candidate Lalitesh Pati Tripathi in Bhadohi. “It is difficult for the SP and Congress to even save their deposit, so they are doing a political experiment in Bhadohi,” Modi said. “TMC politics means murder of Hindus, harassment of Dalits and advasis, atrocities on women. So many BJP leaders were killed there and TMC MLAs say that they will kill Hindus by drowning them in the Ganga,” Modi said. The TMC’s politics included the “poisonous arrow of appeasement”, calling Ram temple “impure”, banning Ram Navami celebrations, sheltering Bangladeshi intruders and “vote jihad”, Modi said. “The Samajawadi shehzade brought a bua (aunt) from West Bengal. Samajwadi shahzade should ask his buaa as to why she calls UP people outsiders,” he added. He was referring to West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who has said called the BJP a party of outsiders since the 2021 West Bengal assembly elections. In Jaunpur, he accused SP and Congress of “abusing” the people of UP when they are in the South. In Pratapgarh, Modi said the INDIA bloc wanted to make five prime ministers in five years and claimed that it will disintegrate after June 4, the day votes are counted for the Lok Sabha elections. Addressing an election rally in support of the BJP candidate and sitting MP Sangam Lal Gupta, the PM said the INDIA bloc wanted to replace the stable NDA government and make five prime ministers in five years. “Many things will happen after June 4. The INDI alliance will disintegrate and they will look for a scapegoat after the defeat.” In an apparent attack on Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, he said, “The shehzade (princes) of Lucknow and Delhi will leave for abroad on summer vacations,” said Modi. Voting will be held in Lalganj, Azamgarh, Jaunpur, Machhlishahr and Pratapgarh constituencies in the sixth phase of the Lok Sabha elections on May 25. INDIA bloc will disintegrate after June 4: Modi in Pratapgarh Addressing a public meeting at an intermediate college in Dharwara, Karchhana in Prayagraj, Digvijay Singh said, “The BJP is spreading hatred in the name of Hindu and Muslim and the people will not forgive them. Lord Ram is revered by all Hindus but BJP worked against Sanatan religion by consecration of Lord Ram in half-built temple.” “This election is for saving democracy and the Constitution of the country. Governments keep changing but there is no dent to the Constitution,” Singh said, adding that no decision was taken in favour of farmers, youths and poor during the last 10 years.
Thiruvananthapuram, May 17 (UNI) Terming the cyberattack on the Regional Cancer Centre (RCC) as an act of cyber terrorism, cyber experts have opined that the FIR filed on the case by Kerala Police was facilitating the evasion of Chinese criminals and whitewashing the crime for the benefit of terrorists. Referring to Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan's recent comment on the State Police’s effectiveness in addressing cybercrimes, although they are generally recognised for their reliability and proficiency, the experts on Friday said the FIR seems like a 'collusive' one, specifically to whitewash the cyber terrorism. Referring to certain vague points in the FIR, the experts clarified that "the cyber-terrorist attack happened in the servers of the RCC, not in the Internet." The FIR has been registered under the Information Technology Act of 2000, invoking provisions 43(a), 43(d), 66, and 65, after two weeks since the event happened. The investigating officer, tasked with elucidating the subsections of 43, has provided rather vague definitions for the latter two sections. It’s important to note that subsections 66(a) through 66(i) under Section 66 are currently in force, except for the Supreme Court’s repeal of 66(a). A concerning factor is the attitude of the investigating officers, which may have inadvertently facilitated the cybercriminals’ evasion, whitewashing, and manipulation of the crime for the terrorist’s benefit, the experts felt. Hence, the investigating officer must be very specific in charging the sections of the IT Act 2000 and follow the mandatory rules of the IT Act, they added. "Section 66F of the IT Act defines cyber terrorism. Section 66F of the Information Technology Act, 2000, defines cyber-terrorism as acts committed with the intent to threaten India's unity, integrity, security, or sovereignty. These acts include denying access to computer resources and attempting to penetrate them without authorisation, introducing computer contaminants, causing death or injury to persons, property damage, disruption of community life, and adverse effects on critical information infrastructure." "Committing these acts constitutes an offence and can result in imprisonment, potentially for life. Section 66F aims to address serious threats posed by cyberattacks, providing legal recourse against those involved, ensuring accountability, and safeguarding critical infrastructure." "The Information Technology Act, 2000, especially Section 66F, is indeed a critical legal framework in the context of cyber-attacks on critical infrastructure." "Cyber terrorism refers to acts committed in the digital realm with the intent to threaten the unity, integrity, security, or sovereignty of a nation. Instill terror in people or specific groups. These acts may include unauthorised access to computer resources, introducing malicious code, or disrupting critical information infrastructure. If such actions cause harm, damage, or disruption, they fall under the offence of cyber terrorism.” In fact, Section 66F addresses serious offences related to cyberterrorism and aims to safeguard national security. This act involves offences such as denying authorised access to a computer resource, attempting unauthorised infiltration or penetration to computer resources controlling critical infrastructure, planting malware or computer contaminants in these critical systems to sabotage normal operations, and stealing restricted information that may harm national security. The consequences include death, injuries, property or control of critical infrastructure damage, and disruption of essential services, which can lead to a doomsday scenario or harm to the critical information infrastructure of India. Whoever commits cyber terrorism shall be punishable with imprisonment, which may extend to life imprisonment. Another matter of grave concern is the belated digital evidence collection. Digital evidence and chain of custody must be done as quickly as possible, with the help of a technical (domain) expert. It is imperative to approach such matters with vigilance and precision to ensure justice and uphold cybersecurity. “In addition to disclosing data, the RCC breach has had an impact on people. Imagine receiving treatment after receiving a diagnosis, only to learn later that someone else has access to your penalised health records. The potential for con artists to take advantage of you is another cause for concern and confusion. RCC's silence adds to the concern. Security professionals' advice to monitor medical statements misses how seriously the intrusion could impact patients' lives.” Section 66 of the IT Act, 2000, has been divided into several sub-sections, denoted as 66A to 66I. Each of these sub-sections addresses specific aspects related to cybercrimes and offences. Section 66A was part of the original IT Act but has since been repealed. It criminalised the sending of offensive messages through a computer or other communication devices. Sending information that is grossly offensive, false, and meant to cause annoyance, inconvenience, danger, obstruction, insult, injury, criminal intimidation, enmity, hatred, or ill will. The Supreme Court ruled in 2015 that Section 66A of the IT Act, 2000, was unconstitutional. The Act aimed to recognise e-commerce and address digital transactions, security, and electronic data. However, the provision faced criticism for its vague language and potential misuse. The Supreme Court declared Section 66A unconstitutional, violating freedom of speech and expression under Article 19 (1) (a) of the Indian Constitution. The provision did not fall within reasonable restrictions permitted by Article 19 (2) and was considered open-ended and susceptible to misuse. Since its repeal, 1,307 cases were still registered under Section 66A across India, highlighting continued enforcement. Section 66B of the IT Act, 2000, deals with the receipt of stolen computer resources or communication devices. Section 66B prescribes penalties for dishonestly handling stolen digital assets, emphasising the importance of ethical conduct in the digital realm. "Whoever dishonestly receives or retains any stolen computer resource or communication device, knowing or having reason to believe the same to be a stolen computer resource or communication device, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years or with a fine which may extend to rupees one lakh. or with both.” This section aims to curb offences related to stolen computer resources or communication devices. If someone knowingly receives or keeps a stolen computer resource or communication device, they can face imprisonment or a fine. The punishment can be imprisonment for up to three years, a fine of up to one lakh rupees, or both. Section 66C of the IT Act, 2000, deals with identity theft. Section 66C emphasises the importance of safeguarding personal identification features and penalises those who misuse them. “Whoever, fraudulently or dishonestly, makes use of the electronic signature, password, or any other unique identification feature of any other person, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to a fine which may extend to rupees one lakh.” This section aims to address offences related to identity theft in the digital realm. If someone fraudulently or dishonestly uses another person’s electronic signature, password, or unique identification feature, they can face imprisonment or a fine. The punishment can be imprisonment for up to three years and a fine of up to one lakh rupees, or both. Section 66D of the IT Act, 2000, deals with the punishment for cheating by personation by using a computer resource. Section 66D emphasises the importance of safeguarding personal identities and penalises those who engage in deceptive impersonation. "Whoever, by means of any communication device or computer resource, cheats by personating shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to a fine, which may extend to one lakh rupees.” This section addresses offences related to identity theft and fraudulent impersonation in the digital domain. If someone fraudulently or dishonestly uses another person’s identity through a communication device or computer resource, they can face imprisonment or a fine. The punishment can be imprisonment for up to three years and a fine of up to one lakh rupees, or both. Section 66E of the IT Act, 2000, deals with violations of privacy. Here are the key points: Whoever intentionally or knowingly captures, publishes, or transmits the image of a private area of any person without their consent, under circumstances that violate the privacy of that person, shall be punished with imprisonment (which may extend to three years), a fine not exceeding two lakh rupees, or both imprisonment and fine." "In essence, Section 66E prohibits electronic voyeurism and penalises the capturing, publishing, and transmission of images of a person’s private area without their consent, under circumstances that violate their privacy. It aims to safeguard individuals’ privacy rights in the digital realm." "Despite the lack of a dedicated book on Section 66F, ongoing efforts to educate, discuss, and analyse this provision are essential for safeguarding critical infrastructure." "Thus, the IT Act, 2000, in India addresses these issues and prescribes penalties for those involved in cyber terrorism." Legal frameworks are a comprehensive system of laws, rules, and principles. that govern a particular jurisdiction. They ensure consistency, fairness, and predictability in legal processes by guiding how laws are interpreted, enforced, and applied. Legal frameworks can be local or national, with local rules pertaining to procedural matters within specific court systems and statutes covering substantive areas applicable to the entire jurisdiction. Jurisdiction, on the other hand, refers to the authority of a court or legal system to hear and decide cases. It determines which court's decisions are binding in a specific matter and can be based on geographical boundaries, subject-matter jurisdiction, or personal jurisdiction. Determining jurisdiction can be complex, especially in cases involving cross-border issues or online activities. Section 66G of the IT Act, 2000, deals with tampering with computer source documents. Section 66G emphasises the importance of preserving the integrity of computer source code. and penalises those who engage in malicious alterations. “Whoever intentionally or knowingly conceals, destroys, alters, or intentionally or knowingly causes another to conceal, destroy, or alter any computer source code used for a computer resource, with an intention to cause damage, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or with a fine that may extend to two lakh rupees. or with both.” This section addresses offences related to tampering with computer source code. If someone intentionally conceals, destroys, or alters computer source code with the intent to cause damage, they can face imprisonment or a fine. The punishment can be imprisonment for up to three years, a fine of up to two lakh rupees, or both. Section 66H of the IT Act, 2000, deals with tampering with computer source documents. Section 66H emphasises the importance of preserving the integrity of computer source code. and penalises those who engage in malicious alterations. “Whoever intentionally or knowingly conceals, destroys, alters, or intentionally or knowingly causes another to conceal, destroy, or alter any computer source code used for a computer resource to cause damage shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years or with a fine which may extend to two lakh rupees, or with both.” This section addresses offences related to tampering with computer source code. If someone intentionally conceals, destroys, or alters computer source code with the intent to cause damage, they can face imprisonment or a fine. The punishment can be imprisonment for up to three years, a fine of up to two lakh rupees, or both. Section 66I of the IT Act, 2000, deals with punishment for dishonestly receiving stolen computer resources or communication devices. Section 66I emphasises the importance of ethical conduct and penalises those who dishonestly handle stolen digital assets. “Whoever dishonestly receives or retains any stolen computer resource or communication device, knowing or having reason to believe the same to be a stolen computer resource or communication device, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years, with a fine which may extend to rupees one lakh, or with both.” This section pertains to offences related to stolen computer resources or communication devices. If someone knowingly receives or keeps a stolen computer resource or communication device, they can face imprisonment or a fine. The punishment can be imprisonment for up to three years, a fine of up to one lakh rupees, or both. In one of the highest volumes of cyberattacks in India, details of 20 lakh patients with the RCC here were compromised, affecting 11 out of 14 servers and causing disruptions in many divisions, including the Radiation Department. The attack compromised the health information of over 20 lakh patients and demanded a ransom in cryptocurrency. UNI DS AKS
NEW DELHI/LUCKNOW: At four back-to-back rallies in Uttar Pradesh’s Lalganj, Jaunpur, Bhadohi, and Pratapgarh on Thursday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi continued his unrelenting attack on the Opposition, accusing the SP and the Cong in particular of “selling appeasement, lies, parivarvad and corruption”. The Prime Minister said that the ongoing general election is an opportunity for the country to choose a leader who can run a strong government, which “makes the world aware of India's strength”. He also repeated his claims that the I.N.D.I.A. bloc wants to make five Prime Ministers in five years and that the Opposition alliance will crumble after June 4. Hitting out at the Samajwadi Party and the Congress for fielding a Trinamul Congress (TMC) candidate in Bhadohi, Modi said that they want to try out the TMC brand of politics in Uttar Pradesh. “There is no chance of the Congress-SP emerging victorious in Bhadohi. They wish to do the TMC-style politics of West Bengal in Uttar Pradesh that is modelled on tushtikaran (appeasement). They want to create a replica of preventing the celebrations of Ram Navami and violence against Hindus and women. They wish to replicate the model of governance where they want to promote political protection for terror,” he said. In Azamgarh, Modi said that earlier people used to think of Azamgarh every time a blast took place anywhere in the country. He asserted that Azamgarh's identity changed a decade ago due to the appeasement politics of the previous SP governments in Uttar Pradesh. "Terrorists accused of explosions were pardoned. Sleeper cells were given the cover of politics. Due to this attitude, terrorism rose across the country. These people still have the same attitude," Modi said, adding, "The SP and the Congress are two parties but have one shop where they sell appeasement, lies, 'parivarvad' and corruption. Speaking about Modi’s guarantee, the Prime Minister said, “The CAA is a testimony to Modi's guarantee. Many people have received the certificates under the CAA, belonging to the six minorities who faced the harsh consequences of the partition of India. The I.N.D.I.A. bloc never cared for them as they weren't a part of their votebank and created a web of lies against the CAA. The law will stay and will provide citizenship to all affiliated with India.” Addressing an election rally organised at a college ground in Jaunpur in support of BJP candidates Kripashankar Singh and B.P. Saroj from the Machhlishahr (reserved) seat, Modi said, "This election is an opportunity to choose the Prime Minister of the country. A Prime Minister who runs a strong government that cannot be dominated by the world but that makes the world aware of India's strength. Therefore, when you vote for our Kripashankar Ji from Jaunpur and Saroj Ji from Machhlishahr, your vote forms a strong government. The votes given to them will go directly into Modi's account." In Pratapgarh, Modi slammed the Congress and the SP for their lackadaisical attitude towards development, mocking their belief that progress happens effortlessly and dismissing hard work. “The SP and the Congress say that the country’s development will happen on its own. What’s the need to work hard for it?" he said. Amid slogans of "Jai Shri Ram" and "Har Har Modi", the Prime Minister said, "Your enthusiasm shows that you have made it difficult for the INDIA bloc to win even a single seat in Uttar Pradesh." "We got the Ram temple in Ayodhya after a wait of 500 years. The entire country is happy. Every Indian living across the world is happy. But these parivarvadis (dynasts) are hurling abuses. The shehzada (prince) of the SP and his uncle call the Ram temple useless (bekar),” he said in apparent reference to a recent statement of SP general secretary Ram Gopal Yadav, who had said that the Ram temple has been built in a useless manner but not as per 'Vaastu'. Attacking SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, Modi said, "The SP's shehzada also makes fun of Kashi. They are crossing every limit to please their votebank. I am surprised that it is the 21st century and they are roaming around with the flag of triple talaq." Accusing the leaders of the I.N.D.I.A. bloc of advocating reservation on the basis of religion, he said, "They advocate reservation on the basis of religion. They want to take away the right of reservation of the SCs, STs and OBCs by changing the Constitution of the country." Repeating his assertion of not allowing religion-based reservations, Modi said, "As long as I am alive, they will not be able to take away the reservations of the OBCs, SCs and tribal people. As long as I am alive, I will not let them do this politics." In Pratapgarh, the Prime Minister said that the I.N.D.I.A. bloc wants to replace the stable NDA government and make five prime ministers in five years. "Many things will happen after June 4. The I.N.D.I.A. bloc will disintegrate and they will look for a scapegoat after the defeat. The shehzade of Lucknow and Delhi will leave for abroad on summer vacations," said Mr Modi, adding, "They have gone from Amethi and will go even from Rae Bareli."
The man who broke into former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's home in 2022 and assaulted her husband with a hammer was sentenced on Friday to 30 years in prison, federal prosecutors said.In a politically motivated attack, David DePape forcibly entered Pelosi's home in San Francisco early in the morning on October 28, 2022, just a week before that year's congressional elections. At the time, Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives, was in Washington.DePape, who according to prosecutors was driven by the far-right conspiracy theories known as QAnon, acknowledged in trial testimony that his intention was to take Pelosi hostage.DePape, 44, confronted Pelosi's husband, Paul, and clubbed him over the head with a hammer before police who had been called to the scene were able to subdue the attacker. A jury found DePape guilty in November of attempting to kidnap a federal officer and assaulting an immediate family member of a federal officer.Paul Pelosi, 82, suffered skull fractures and other injuries that have continued to affect him, as he described in a letter to the judge ahead of Friday's sentencing. In addition to dizziness and a metal plate that remains in his head, Pelosi said he struggles with balance and has permanent nerve damage in his left hand.In a separate letter, Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat who was the first woman to be elected House speaker, urged the judge to impose a "very long" punishment.She noted that DePape reportedly shouted "Where's Nancy?" upon breaking into her home, echoing what some intruders yelled inside the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of then-President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the building seeking to overturn President Joe Biden's election.Prosecutors had asked US District Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley in San Francisco federal court to sentence DePape, a Canadian national living illegally in the US, to 40 years in prison.In court papers, the Justice Department argued that while he was not convicted of a terrorism crime, his offenses nevertheless met the definition because he was aiming to affect the government through "intimidation or coercion." Prosecutors also said DePape had not shown remorse for his actions.DePape's court-appointed defense lawyer had asked for a sentence of 14 years, saying he had become unmoored in the years leading up to the attack due in part to an abusive relationship.DePape still faces separate state charges stemming from the Pelosi break-in and attack, including attempted murder, that carry a potential sentence of 13 years to life in prison. He has pleaded not guilty.In a statement following Friday's sentencing, a spokesperson for Pelosi said, "The Pelosi family couldn't be prouder of their Pop and his tremendous courage in saving his own life on the night of the attack and in testifying in this case," referring to Paul Pelosi's family nickname.

Amit Shah said PM Modi will put in jail all those who have committed corruption.Raebareli: Union Home Minister Amit Shah at an election rally here on Friday attacked Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi for calling Raebareli a "family seat", and said it's not a seat of any family but that of the people.Mr Shah made a scathing attack on the Congress for turning down invitations for Ram Mandir's 'Pran Pratishtha' in Ayodhya and said if the Congress came to power, they would put the "Ayodhya lock" in the temple again.Mr Shah held a public meeting in Daulatpur of the Unchahar assembly constituency.

External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar came down heavily on Pakistan for unrelentingly practicing terrorism and said that the south Asian nation will be treated like normal if they shut down their terror industry. .live_stock #sr_widget .sr_desc #sr_widget .sr_desc .live_stock .lb-icon "The ball is in their court. If they wind down this industry that they have built up in many decades, then people will treat them like a normal neighbour. If they make this their core competence, then obviously that will define their image," Jaishankar said at a CII event on Friday. "Where Pakistan is concerned, one, we have struggled continuously with the fact that they have unrelentingly practiced terrorism. This attitude in our country earlier that we put up with terrorism as an eccentricity of our neighbour, that's the way they are, and we have to live with it...," he said.Jaishankar emphasized that in 2014, India unequivocally resolved not to endure any instances of cross-border terrorism.Jaishankar emphasized that in 2014, India unequivocally resolved not to endure any instances of cross-border terrorism."I think the people of this nation made a very clear decision in 2014 that they are not going to accept it. In this country, I think the tolerance for any kind of cross-border terrorism activity is very low. There will be consequences, both across the LoC and across the IB, if something like this happens. That is the message of Uri and Balakot," the EAM said.He noted that in 2019, Imran Khan's government in Pakistan took various steps to degrade the relations."So we have been very straight, that they have to make up their mind and part of the problem is also, after 2019, when Imran Khan's government took several steps that downgrade the relationship, we didn't do it, they did it," he said.Further, talking about China, Jaishankar stressed that it is "more complex".There are at least three aspects to it, he added. One, fundamental aspect is that the peace and tranquillity in the border area is disturbed, he noted."Would you do business with somebody who had just barged into your drawing room and is trying to make a mess of your house? there is a common sense proposition here," he said.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)
Talking about his participation in the election campaign as he addressed many seminars and delivered many talks on the Modi government's foreign policies amid the ongoing election, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said he is more comfortable in doing townhall kind of things. In an exclusive interview with Hindustan Times, he also busted the myth that foreign policies do not matter in elections as he said everywhere he goes, he is asked a set of questions on foreign policy. Jaishankar said the line between foreign policy and domestic policy has been blurred. The line between foreign and domestic policy has got blurred, Jaishankar said explaining that India buying Russian oil is a matter of foreign policy but the consumer is the people of the country who will pay at the petrol pump and thus it becomes a domestic policy.

Jaishankar reveals real story behind 'Modi ji ne war rukva di papa' "I find it very interesting because when I have gone to about nine or 10 states during the elections, I almost invariably get a set of questions on foreign policy. So I think somewhere it has seeped into people’s consciousness. What has seeped into it? One, a sense of pride about where Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken the country. Two, an understanding that some danger outside, it could be a pandemic, it could be terrorism, will not stay outside, and will come home. So it’s very interesting. If you look at the BJP manifesto, I think we have given much more space to foreign policy than we have ever given before," Jaishankar said. On his active participation in the election campaign, he said different people have different styles of communication. While Narendra Modi and Amit Shah are extraordinary in mass communication, Jaishankar said he finds himself comfortable in townhall type of addresses. "I find I am much more comfortable and much more effective in doing more of a town hall kind of thing. Sure, town halls can be pretty big. I did one in Mumbai, a day before yesterday, there must have been about 2,000 people," Jaishankar said. "Since I became a minister, I have actually spent a lot of my time talking to young people. So, in that sense, a lot of their concerns and interests have been absorbed over the last five years. I find young people are actually very, very taken with what they believe is greater respect today for India at the world stage. They are fascinated. You have no idea how many times this Ukraine issue has come up. And sometimes, I actually talk to them about other operations. You know we did a very risky operation in Sudan. Our embassy was actually physically occupied by one of the combatant sides. I tell them how for example we organised oxygen supply, the kind of effort we made abroad or how you know there was a time when the US had put a ban on any vaccine ingredients going out…, how we persuaded the US. I think it’s good to see that sense of nationalism in young people because often when I travel out, my peer group ministers, they don’t have that same degree of optimism in their societies," Jaishankar added.
Vibha Sharma Chandigarh, May 16 Long queues outside banks, ATMs and shopkeepers insisting on cash transactions for essentials, Cuba, one of the more-influential states of the Caribbean region, is in deep economic crisis, in fact, one of the worst in decades, according to economists. Amid near-day blackouts, food shortages and worsening economic crisis, Cubans have also been taking to the streets. Triggered by the situation during the Covid pandemic, protests against the Cuban government started in July 2021 and only kept aggravating. In 2024, Cuba's peso currency lost nearly half its value against the dollar, deeply cutting into the buying power of Cubans, already rattled by power outages, inflation and shortages. India, which happens to be among the first countries to extend recognition to the new Cuban government following the Cuban revolution in January 1959, has been collaborating and helping Cuba in many ways and areas, including energy. Experts say while India and many other countries are doing their bit, it was time the US started "loosening the noose" of hash sanctions imposed several decades back. The United States embargo against Cuba prevents US businesses, and businesses organised under US law or majority-owned by US citizens, from conducting trade with Cuban interests. "The sanctions have been the most enduring trade embargo in modern history. You can blame the Cuban government for mismanaging the economy if you want but the damage caused by longstanding US economic sanctions has been equally dilapidating," says a former diplomat. According to Professor Sonya Surabhi Gupta, a Latin American specialist from Jamia Millia Islamia, India has always supported Cuba in various ways and some recent examples are the line of credit and technical support extended in different sectors, especially renewable energy where they are most required by a power-deficient country. "India has historically supported Cuba and is continuing with its show of solidarity. However, the US is not loosening (on sanctions). Unfortunately, there has been a total disregard and disrespect for international law and opinion. Cuba has been able to survive all this while only because of international support. The protests happening there may not necessarily be against the government, they are also because of exasperation with harsh conditions forced on the people who just want a better life. "Despite all the hardships, Cuba is doing exceedingly well in education, health and pharmaceuticals. In fact, they have the best vaccines for diseases like ovarian cancer and hepatitis but cannot market them for greater good of humanity because of US sanctions," says Professor Gupta. Some light at the end of the tunnel was recently perceived when the US removed Cuba from a short list of countries it alleged are "not cooperating fully" in its fight against terrorism as per reports. According to some geo-political experts, the decision marked "a tepid if symbolically important move" on behalf of the Joe Biden government, which had been carrying on with the Donald Trump-era restrictions on the Communist-run island.
"Congress party was not acting against Article 370 but Modi ji abrogated it."Raebareli: While addressing a public meeting in Uttar Pradesh's Raebareli Union Home Minister Amit Shah launched a scathing attack against the Congress party and said that they have looted people of the country for decades.Carrying out an election campaign in support of the BJP candidates from Amethi (Smriti Irani) and Raebareli (Dinesh Pratap Singh) Lok Sabha constituencies, he said that both of them are working very hard and the party will register a victory in both the constituencies.Slamming the INDIA alliance, Amit Shah said, "After a long wait, we got Ram Mandir in Ayodhya.

QUETTA: The two-day Pakistan Literature Festival (PLF) in Quetta concluded on Thursday with assorted sessions where speakers called for more spotlight on Balocshitan’s issues and the importance of cultural activities for youth. The event, organised by the Arts Council of Pakistan (ACP) Karachi in the Balochistan University of Information Technology, Engine­ering and Management Sciences (Buitems), received heavy footfall of literature and cultural enthusiasts who attended multiple sessions. One of the sessions titled ‘National media and Balochistan’ discussed the role of mainstream new channels in highlighting the province’s issues. Anchor Absa Komal moderated the session with journalists Mazhar Abbas, Shahzeb Jillani, Shahzada Zulfiqar, Rafat Saeed, and Shahid Rind as panellists. The speakers minced no words while talking about the treatment of mainstream media towards Balochistan. Comedian Sohail Ahmed professes ‘Punjab’s love for Balochistan’; CM calls for dialogue to curb terrorism They lamented that Balochistan “was not even part of the mainstream media discourse” to the extent that not a single news show was aired from Balochistan on private TV channels. One of the speakers said that even the national broadcaster, Pakistan Television, does not broadcast dramas, musicals and other programmes from Baloch­istan. Another session titled ‘Bushra Ansari: The one and only’ was held in recognition of one of the country’s most prominent female artists. Ms Ansari was part of the panel during the session moderated by actor Yasir Hussain. In a candid moment, she asked the participants who among them wanted to take up acting and music as careers. Her question received an enthusiastic affirmation as several boys and girls raised their hands. She told the crowd about her starting point as a child artist and reminded them that hard work was the most important requirement of the profession. ‘Punjab’s love for Balochistan’ A fun-filled session was ‘Hasna Hasana Sohail Ahmed (Azizi) Kay Sath’. Mr Ahmed, the famed comedian, was the panellist on the eponymous show where he professed Punjab’s love for Balochistan. “The people of Punjab love the people of Balochistan,” he said while standing on the stage. “This is the message of my people. They have a lot of sympathy for you,” he said while lamenting that some misunderstandings have been created by the rulers. The closing ceremony was attended by Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti who was the chief guest. He was welcomed by ACP Karachi’s president, Mohammad Ahmed Shah. He thanked the ACP for the festival and acknowledged the efforts of his government and the Buitems vice chancellor to bring literature, arts, showbiz and journalism enthusiasts to Quetta. CM’s address In his address, Mr Bugti decried the rhetoric about Balochistan where its people “who are already at the receiving end” were blamed for problems instead of the state, which was responsible for providing facilities like health and education to its citizens. He also spoke extensively on the pessimism among Balocshitan’s young population, saying that the youth were disappointed with the government. “Our youth is wandering aimlessly with degrees [but] jobs are being sold,” the CM claimed, and vowed that this won’t happen in his tenure as he would promote merit in public appointments. On the issue of harmony between Baloch and Punjabis, the CM said it was important to retain the professors of Punjabi and other languages in Balochistan universities. He stressed the importance of negotiations in eliminating terrorism from the province. Published in Dawn, May 17th, 2024
The United Nations Security Council on Thursday held a meeting solely focused on the hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip, even as Israel pushes forward with its Rafah operation. During the meeting, the US condemned the hostage taking by the Palestinian Islamist group on October 7 as a "psychological tool of terrorism". US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said they "won't rest" until the release of every single hostage is secured.Over 1,200 people were killed after Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7 last year. Additionally, more than 200 people were taken as hostages by the Islamist group. Several of them were released during a brief truce between the two sides, but 132 remain in captivity, Israel's UN Ambassador Gilad Erdan told the meeting on Thursday. In three resolutions passed by the UN Security Council on Thursday, it called for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages. Meanwhile, Israel's UN Ambassador Gilad Erdan questioned the Council's action so far against Hamas until they release the hostages. "Have you imposed sanctions...? What action has been taken?" he asked. At Thursday's UN Security Council meeting, Shoshan Haran recalled the 50 days she was in Hamas's captivity. She, her daughter and two grandchildren were taken hostage by the group on October 7 last year, and released in November. "We cannot allow the normalisation of this unprecedented form of terrorism...," Haran, now 68, said. The Republican-led US House of Representatives passed a bill on Thursday that would force President Joe Biden to send weapons to Israel, in response to him delaying bomb shipments, over fears of mass Palestinian casualties. On Tuesday (May 14), the US State Department moved a $1 billion package of weapons aid for Israel into the congressional review process, news agency Reuters reported, citing officials. The Israel Security Assistance Support Act was approved 224 to 187, largely along party lines. As many as 16 Democrats joined most Republicans in voting for the Act, and three Republicans joined most Democrats in opposing the same. The Act is not expected to become law, but its passage underscored the U.S. election-year divide over Israel policy. US Defense Secretary Llyod Austin reiterated in a phone call with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant the "unquestionable necessity" of protecting civilians and ensuring humanitarian aid continues to flow without any interruption to the Gaza Strip before any potential operation in Rafah, the Pentagon said.
The United States has announced sanctions on two Russian individuals and three Russian companies for their involvement in facilitating arms transfers between Russia and North Korea. This includes the transfer of ballistic missiles intended for use in Ukraine. This move, initiated by the Treasury and State departments, aims to disrupt and expose the illicit arms trade between the two nations, as highlighted in a recent Treasury Department statement.Allegations have been made by the US, claiming that Russia has utilized North Korea as a conduit to support its military actions in Ukraine. The US further asserts that the close relationship between Russia and North Korea poses a significant threat to global security and the international non-proliferation regime, according to Reuters.“Today’s action reflects our commitment to disrupt the DPRK’s (Democratic People’s Republic of North Korea) deepening military cooperation with Russia,” Brian Nelson, the under secretary of the Treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in the statement. “The United States will continue to take action to hold accountable those who seek to facilitate the shipment of weapons and other materiel to enable Russia’s war,” Nelson added.The statement revealed a notable increase in military cooperation between Russia and North Korea, highlighting Pyongyang’s provision of ballistic missiles and munitions to Russia in exchange for military assistance. The collaboration between the two nations has intensified over the past year, reflecting a strategic alignment that has significant implications.In response to these concerning developments, new sanctions have been imposed. This action comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping solidified their ‘strategic partnership,’ emphasizing their united stance while criticizing the United States, particularly regarding North Korea.They also coincided with a U.S. announcement that it was seeking information about three North Korean workers linked to the Communist country’s Munitions Industry Department and an American accomplice involved in a scheme to secure illicit IT work with U.S. firms and government agencies.U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Russia had already used upwards of 40 North Korean-produced ballistic missiles against Ukraine, as well as munitions, importing them in contravention of United Nations resolutions.Russia and China, North Korea’s oldest ally, have repeatedly blocked attempts to impose new UN sanctions on North Korea over its banned ballistic missile tests, according to Al Jazeera.

Congress candidate from Chandigarh parliamentary constituency Manish Tewari on Thursday asserted that unlike the Bharatiya Janata Party, which only talks about nationalism with its characteristic ‘jumlebazi’, the Congress party and its leaders have a tradition and history of martyrdom and sacrificing their lives for the nation. Tewari reiterated the Congress’ welfare guarantees including doubling the free monthly ration to the poor, paying Rs 8500 every month to poor families and guaranteed first year jobs for all graduates and diploma holders. Replying to a question, during an interaction with reporters, that the BJP leaders were claiming that India had emerged stronger under the BJP rule, as compared to the Congress, Tewari retorted, “yes verbally, but not practically, as it had weakened actually”, while referring to China still occupying India’s land and the BJP leadership being timidly quiet. He pointed out, it was during the Congress regime under late Indira Gandhi that India divided Pakistan into two parts and created a new country, Bangladesh. He said that Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi laid down their lives for the unity and integrity of the country. Tewari, whose father Professor Vishwanath Tewari was also shot dead by Punjab militants during terrorism in Punjab, challenged the BJP leadership to quote one single example where their leaders have sacrificed their lives for the nation or made the country proud. Tewari shifting constituencies in every Lok Sabha election: Tandon Chandigarh: BJP candidate for Chandigarh Lok Sabha seat, Sanjay Tandon on Thursday asked the Congress nominee Manish Tewari to share with the voters in Chandigarh how his performance had been as an MP from Ludhiana and Shri Anandpur Sahib. Tandon said while Tewari has been claiming himself to be a national leader, it has always been a mystery why he has been changing his Lok Sabha constituency in every Lok Sabha election since 2014. "Now that he is contesting from Chandigarh, which constituency will he shift to in the 2029 Lok Sabha elections? Tandon questioned. Tandon wondered why the Congress nominees in Ludhiana and Shri Anandpur Sahib constituencies which were rarely represented by him in the past are not calling him to campaign in favour of the Congress. Tandon said that Tewari is the only MP who has been running from one constituency to another in the last 10 years for the simple reason that he has nothing to show back to his voters. "He is playing a similar trick on voters in Chandigarh", warned Tandon. Page generated in 0.0282 seconds.
New tensions have emerged in land and sea in Asia as agreements were dishonoured and rule of law disregarded, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Friday amid China's continuing military posturing along the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh and its bullying tactics in South China Sea.In an address at an event hosted by the CII, Jaishankar also talked about the power of currency and how "threat of sanctions" are deployed in the "toolbox" of global diplomacy, in remarks that came days after the US warned of sanctions after India and Iran sealed a deal on the Chabahar port.In a veiled reference to Pakistan, the external affairs minister said terrorism and extremism have started to consume those who have long practised it.Jaishankar extensively delved into the consequences of the Ukraine conflict, escalation of violence in West Asia and disruption of logistics in view of the geopolitical tensions, sanctions, incidents of drone attacks and climate events."The world is experiencing a 3F crisis of fuel, food and fertilisers. In Asia, new tensions have emerged in land and sea as agreements are dishonoured and rule of law disregarded," he said at the annual general meeting of the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII)."Terrorism and extremism have started to consume those who have long practised it. In many ways, we are actually going through the perfect storm," he said."For India, the task is to mitigate its impact on itself and contribute to stabilising the world to the extent possible. It is this judicious combination of 'Bharat First' and 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam' that defines our image as 'Vishwa Bandhu'," he said. Page generated in 0.0707 seconds.
Abuja, May 16 (AP) At least eight worshippers were killed and 16 others injured early Wednesday morning after a man attacked a mosque with a locally made explosive in northern Nigeria’s Kano state, resulting in a fire outbreak, the police said.The suspect, a 38-year-old local resident, confessed that he attacked the mosque in Kano’s remote Gadan village “purely in hostility following (a) prolonged family disagreement,” police spokesman Abdullahi Haruna said in a statement on Wednesday.Eight of those injured died later in a hospital, Haruna later told local Channels Television on Thursday. Four children were among the injured worshippers, although it was not clear if any of the children died.The incident caused panic in Kano, northern Nigeria’s largest state, where periodic religion-related unrest has occurred over the years, sometimes resulting in violence.The suspect invaded the mosque with “a locally prepared bomb and exploded it,” local police chief Umar Sanda told reporters. “It has nothing to do with terrorism”.Footage broadcast by the local TVC station showed charred walls and burned furniture in the mosque, the main place of worship for Gadan village in Muslim-dominated Kano state.Local media also reported the worshippers were locked inside the mosque, making it difficult for them to escape. “Some children ran for their lives with fire all over them. We had to put water to quench it,” Hussaini Adamu, a resident, told TVC. The police cordoned off the scene while the injured were rushed to a hospital in the state capital.“The disagreement (was) over sharing of inheritance of which those that (the attacker) alleged to have cheated on him were in the mosque at that moment and he did that for his voice to be heard,” the police statement said.

Actor Kangana Ranaut Thursday slammed the opposition leaders over their "pro-Pakistan" remarks and said if the neighbouring country is not wearing bangles, India will make it wear them. Speaking at a public meeting in Kullu, the BJP's candidate from Mandi Lok Sabha constituency said, "We know that Pakistan needs atta (flour) and electricity. But we were not aware that it does not even have bangles." Recently, National Conference president Farooq Abdullah had said "Pakistan ne churian nahi pahni hain" and it possesses atom bomb. Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar released a video saying talks with Pakistan are necessary to put an end to terrorism otherwise it would think that India was trying to belittle Pakistan and in such a situation any "insane" can use atom bomb. Reacting to the statement, Kangana said, "Vo kehte hain, Pakistan ne churian nahi pahni hain... arrey bhai, nahin pehni hai to hum pehna denge (They say Pakistan is not wearing bangles... if Pakistan is not wearing bangles, we will make them wear it)." She said India does not want an unstable and weak Congress government headed by a frightened prime minister. The actor-politician said the Congress wants to snatch the reservation for the Dalits, Mahadalits and the tribal people and give it to Muslims. But the prime minister (Narendra Modi) will never allow it to happen. She said Modi will neither allow the Constitution to be tinkered with nor give the reservation on the basis of religion. Urging the people to give every vote to the BJP in order to strengthen the hands of Modi, Kangna said pressing any other button would mean that their vote has gone waste.
Chief Minister Mohan Yadav, while addressing the public meeting organized in Jayanagar in support of BJP candidate Manish Jaiswal from Hazaribagh (Jharkhand) Lok Sabha seat, Jail Ground Chhatro, Barhi and BJP candidate Smt. Annapurna Devi from Koderma Lok Sabha seat, said that the Congress party has done the work of tarnishing the country.They divided the country, kept Lord Ram sitting in the open sky, imposed Article 370, but now the reins of the country are in the strong and capable hands of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Now the country will not be allowed to be tarnished by the actions of dishonest people. Congress has done the work of tarnishing the country, Prime Minister Modi has increased the respect of the country. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said that neither will he eat nor will he let him eat, that is why the dishonest people are in jail.Chief Minister Yadav said that on one hand Rahul Gandhi is dreaming of becoming the Prime Minister, but on the other hand he is not finding candidates to contest the elections.Congress and its leader Rahul Gandhi say that compete with me, I am not afraid, but how to compete, five generations of Congress were born in Delhi, but the people of Congress do not have the courage to compete in Delhi. It is the misfortune of this country that the British left the country, but left the Congress. They had spoiled our education policy, where are their ideals? Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, we implemented the new education policy and worked to include our ideal great men in the curriculum.Chief Minister Mohan Yadav said that the Congress Party has committed the great sin of tarnishing the country. Ruled the country for 70 years, but could not build the temple of Lord Shri Ram.  Always kept fighting Hindus and Muslims and continued doing his politics. Section 370 was imposed in Kashmir and when Prime Minister Narendra Modiji took the initiative to remove it, there were obstacles in that too. Could not implement law like triple talaq in the country. Made the lives of Muslim sisters and daughters hell. Today the Muslim sisters and daughters of the country are living a happy life because Prime Minister Narendra Modi implemented the law like Triple Talaq in the country.Yadav said that Prime Minister Narendra Modiji had said that neither will I eat nor will I allow anyone to eat. This is the government of BJP and Prime Minister Modiji. Here, instead of dishonest people, they are in jail. Dr. Yadav said that there has been big corruption in Jharkhand also. You may name yourself Alamgir, but this is your thief Gir. If you steal, you will go to jail, you will not find anyone to save you. I have to unfortunately say that brother Jaiprakash was with us when he was Jaiprakash, now you have changed sides so you have become Paraj Prakash. No one can stop you from defeat.The Chief Minister said that when the first vote was given to Prime Minister Narendra Modiji in 2014, terrorism was eliminated from the country. Before 2014, bombs used to explode anywhere in the country, but now it does not happen.Pakistan had committed a mistake once and was taught a lesson by entering the house twice. When the second vote was cast in 2019, Article 370 was removed from Kashmir, laws like triple talaq were implemented, Shri Ram temple was constructed and now Lord Shri Ram is smiling in the sanctum sanctorum.This time the vote has to be cast for the prosperity of the country as well as for Lord Krishna.Chief Minister Yadav said that Jharkhand is such a rich state that if its mineral wealth is properly utilized then this state can become the number one state in the country. This is the land of Lord Birsa Munda. Here there is a desire to break all the barriers and come among you. Page generated in 0.0341 seconds.
Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday claimed that the country faced an identity crisis while every citizen’s security was under threat during the previous Congress-led government at the Centre.“Earlier, whenever a terrorist incident took place in the country and the world, its links were invariably established with Azamgarh, defaming the district for no fault of its own,” he said, adding that those who defamed Azamgarh stand completely exposed today.The chief minister was addressing a rally in the Lalganj Lok Sabha constituency in Azamgarh in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to seek votes for BJP’s Azamgarh candidate Dinesh Lal Yadav Nirahua and Lalganj nominee Neelam Sonkar. Continuing his attack on the opposition, Adityanath said, “The country faced an identity crisis while every individual’s security was under threat in the previous Congress governments. Development activities had come to a grinding halt because the Congress-led government was mired in corruption. The poor starved to death while farmers committed suicide as well as daughters and traders were unsafe.” He said that the country has witnessed a “changing India” in the last 10 years, with increased global respect, secure borders, and terrorism and Naxalism having been effectively eradicated. Highlighting the ‘Modi ki Guarantee’, Adityanath said that a university has been built in Azamgarh in the name of Maharaja Suheldev.Besides, Azamgarh boasts of an airport today and is now connected via the Purvanchal Expressway, he added.“Azamgarh has transformed into a new symbol of progress within Uttar Pradesh, boasting exceptional four-lane connections to key destinations such as Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Ayodhya, Prayagraj, and various other districts.“Previously, the mention of Azamgarh would elicit shock both nationally and internationally. Back then, residents encountered challenges when travelling domestically or abroad, as even lodging in dharamshalas proved difficult to secure for those hailing from Azamgarh,” he said. “However, under the leadership of PM Modi, Azamgarh residents have experienced a notable elevation in respect and have embraced a renewed sense of identity. This transformation is evidenced by the resounding chant of ‘Ab ki Baar, 400 Paar’ echoing across the nation,” he said.Adityanath highlighted the significance of Lord Ram’s presence in Ayodhya temple after a 500-year anticipation, which has deeply moved citizens nationwide.At the rally, UP ministers Surya Pratap Shahi, Dara Singh Chauhan, Om Prakash Rajbhar, MP Sangeeta Azad, and BJP state general secretary Govind Narayan Shukla, among others, were present.Polling in Lalganj and Azamgarh will be held in the sixth phase of the ongoing Lok Sabha elections on May 25.

External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Thursday said that the attack that happened against Israel was "terrorism", adding that response will be there if any country is a victim of terrorism. .live_stock #sr_widget .sr_desc #sr_widget .sr_desc .live_stock .lb-icon "What happened against Israel on October 7th was terrorism, there is no question of second thought. If there is terrorism against any country or if any country is becomes the victim of terrorism, then it's natural that a response will be there," Jaishankar said while addressing a programme event titled 'Vishwabandhu Bharat' in Nashik.The conflict in Gaza escalated after Hamas carried out a massive terror attack against Israel on October 7, killing over 1200 people, taking around 250 people hostage and even committing sexual assault against civilians. In response, Israel launched a strong counteroffensive targeting the Hamas terror units in the Gaza Strip.Further, he slams the opposition, stating that they are not ready to say anything regarding the Israel-Hamas war because if they do so, their vote bank will be affected."I am aware that there are some parties that are refraining to speak as they have some other calculation. They think that their vote bank calculation will be disrupted," EAM Jaishankar said.During his address, he also advised to prevent the loss of civilian lives and stressed on the need for a long-term solution to the Palestinian issue."But we also need to think about the civilians, to ensure that innocent lives are not lost. And in the long term, this Palestinian issue, Palestinians need to find a solution for their country," said Jaishankar."So whenever such situations arise, I believe that if we keep our point forward with fairness and directness, people will understand that our stance is genuine. As Modi says, we are on the side of peace, we are on the side of stability, "said Jaishankar."So the more balanced our position is, the more people should feel that it is a fair position, that you are not being cunning; there are only some ethics and morals involved in this approach," he added.India's position on Israel and Palestine is long-standing and consistent. India supports a two-state solution where Palestine is a sovereign, independent, and viable state within secure borders, living in peace with Israel. India also supports Palestine's full membership at the UN and believes that only a two-state solution achieved through direct negotiations will bring lasting peace to the region.https://twitter.com/DrSJaishankar/status/1791042046465020171Earlier, on the same day, Jaishankar also visited the Shree Kalaram Temple of Prabhu Ram in Nashik and prayed for the blessing of "Viksit Bharat." Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday that India sent a special envoy to Israel during its war with the Hamas terror group, to urge them to maintain peace rather than engage in combat during the month of Ramadan.In an interview with Republic TV, PM Modi stressed on Friday that Israel should not fight, at least during the auspicious month of Ramadan."The time when Israel and Hamas were at war. I sent my special envoy to Israel to explain that Ramadan is going on. At least don't fight in Ramadan, don't attack anyone," PM Modi said."Secondly, I said that during the month of Ramadan, whatever the people need, India wants to send them, there should not be any hindrance. So this is our character and when we do this, we don't brag about it. Sometimes we get success, sometimes we don't. But we are doing it," he said.While speaking regarding the Israel-Hamas war, PM Modi stated that when the world is choosing sides, we maintain a clear stance, India stands for peace."All the groups in the world. The community is formed. Almost all the communities want India's presence in some form or another. So, India is in a good position. As far as the issue of conflict is concerned, the world is taking the position," he said.However, adding, "We are the only ones who have a clear stand, we are not on the side of anyone. We are on the side of peace," PM Modi emphasised.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)

Banda (UP), May 16 (UNI) Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday in a strong rebuttal to Aam Aadmi Party convener and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal's claims hinting at Yogi's removal, asserted that the AAP leader has lost his mind after remaining in jail for 50 days. Addressing an election rally for the Hamirpur-Mahoba Lok Sabha seat in Tindwari, Yogi said, "Kejriwal, who shattered his mentor Anna Hazare's aspirations and sided with the corrupt, is now targeting me. Kejriwal has embraced Congress, against whom Anna protested, like a necklace." It may be noted that earlier in the day, Kejriwal claimed that Yogi will be removed from the post of Uttar Pradesh CM within two months, if BJP returns to power at the Centre. Yogi urged the public to cast their votes in favour of the party candidate Pushpendra Singh Chandel from Hamirpur-Mahoba constituency. "Kejriwal has shattered Anna Hazare's hopes. It must be disheartening for Anna to witness the kind of politics that has arisen from his movement," Yogi said just days after Hazare while voting in the fourth phase of Lok Sabha polls berated Kejriwal for his involvement in the Delhi Liquor scam. Suggesting that Anna Hazare might never forgive him for this betrayal. He said that since assuming power, the AAP has surrounded itself with corrupt individuals. He said that with Kejriwal in jail, the people of Delhi felt a sense of relief, as if their 'cough' had subsided, but his release would likely cause them to 'cough' again. The CM highlighted the significance of the Tindwara assembly, stating its historical importance in shaping the nation's trajectory. "This assembly has not only produced a CM for the state but also a Prime Minister for the country. When I was invited to participate in a programme here, I felt compelled to attend," he said. He underscored the remarkable transformation witnessed in Bundelkhand over the past decade. "Previously, this region was dominated by various mafias, including the mining mafia, land mafia, forest mafia and dacoits. Samajwadi Party and Congress were complicit in protecting these criminal elements," he said. Yogi said, "They would nominate such individuals as public representatives, allowing the mafia and dacoits to exploit the populace and plunder the region's resources. As a result, the youth of Bundelkhand were compelled to migrate, while daughters and sisters faced the arduous task of fetching water from afar." Asserting that the people have witnessed a transformation in Bundelkhand over the past decade, the UP CM said, "This is just the beginning. Bundelkhand will once again lead the country. Gone are the days when daughters and sisters had to travel miles to fetch water. Every household will now have access to tap water and that too, purified through RO systems." The CM said, "In terms of connectivity, every road is being expanded to accommodate two lanes and four lanes. Tourist destinations are being developed to attract visitors. Our defence corridor will be so robust that when our soldiers fire cannons on the border, it will proudly display 'Made in Banda'." He said that the youth here struggled to find employment in the past. "However, in the next five years, the tables will turn, and the world will come here seeking job opportunities. By linking Jhansi to Chitrakoot, Mahoba, Hamirpur, and Banda, we aim to establish developed cities comparable to Noida and Greater Noida," he said. In a scathing critique of the opposition, Yogi asserted that those who once left Bundelkhand yearning for water and development, compromised the safety of sisters and daughters, robbed youth of job opportunities, and plundered resources, should now be made to yearn for every vote. "Ensure that such individuals lose their deposits in the current elections," he said. He said that parties like SP, Congress, AAP, and RJD belong to the same category. "When they come into power, they exploit the common man. Fortunately, we have witnessed the transformation of India. The nation's reputation is growing globally, with welfare schemes benefiting the poor. After 500 years, Lord Ram has finally returned to his rightful place," he said. He said that when Lord Ram embarked on his journey to the forest, he specifically chose Chitrakoot and Bundelkhand. "Ram, whom Nishadraj eagerly awaited, has now reclaimed his rightful throne," he said. Yogi emphasised that every family that has cast their vote for the 'lotus' symbol can rightfully claim credit for the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya. "This collective virtue unites you all," he said while urging voters not to support sinners, tyrants, corrupt individuals, or traitors. He highlighted that their votes have contributed to liberating India from terrorism, Naxalism, mafias, and dacoits. UNI AB ING
In 2014, though the Narendra Modi wave was visible across the country, pollsters and political pundits were not sure of the Bharatiya Janata Party romping home with full majority on its own. Even the saffron party was not confident enough of crossing the simple majority mark. Neither did the Congress expect to score its lowest seat tally. The anti-Congress sentiment, largely because of the India Against Corruption movement led by Anna Hazare and spotlit by media, was so strong that the BJP benefited massively from a negative vote against the Congress. The Congress lost badly because it did not have a convincing counter-narrative.Nor did it talk about its achievements during the 10 years of UPA rule — MNREGA, Right to Food Act, Right to Education Act, Right to Information Act and high economic growth that lifted millions out of poverty. Allegations of corruption and high inflation were the major issues that were exploited by Narendra Modi who campaigned on a platform of change and inclusionary development to bring down the curtain on the Congress-led UPA government. If 2014 was an election for change, it was also an election of hope. It played well on a narrative that pitted a 56-inch-chest hero out to rescue the nation against an identifiable villain.In 2019, the BJP had a lot of things going against it — demonetisation, the hastily-imposed GST, and many unfulfilled promises. Facing a stiff challenge from the Congress, the BJP was expected to lose a good number of seats in the Hindi heartland. Then the Pulwama terrorist attack and the retaliatory Balakot airstrikes happened in mid-February. The nationalist sentiment that PM Modi evoked at every election rally and his frequent exhortation around Balakot and terrorism helped turn around the BJP’s waning fortunes. As the Opposition had no counter, Pulwama and Balakot heavily influenced the BJP’s campaign, and Modi’s jingoistic narrative delivered a bigger victory for the BJP.Both 2014 and 2019 were wave elections. But 2024 is not only a waveless but a lacklustre election. A record turnout in 2019 had helped BJP tremendously and the party was hoping that Modi’s popularity and his consecration of the Ram temple earlier this year would lead to a repeat. That does not seem to be happening and people have already voted for 380 seats that have gone to the polls in four phases so far. While the BJP is still the pollsters’ favourite to win, the party and its leaders appear to be oddly nervous. This is because the election has not panned out as the party expected, and the BJP’s worries are compounded by the INDIA bloc’s challenge which, according to reports, is proving to be too tough for the BJP to neutralise.In fact, various ground reports from the battleground states — Bihar, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal — and some of the Hindi heartland states like Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan suggest that the election dynamics have turned against the BJP and worries are piling up for the Hindutva party which is likely to struggle to get a working majority. This is evident in Modi’s demeanour and messaging which has shifted from confident to shrill. Having stopped promoting his accomplishments of the past 10 years and his guarantees offered in the BJP’s manifesto for his third consecutive term, it is not without a reason that the prime minister’s campaign shifted to making the majority community fear and loathe the Congress and Muslims. Political analysts read this as a sign of panic and desperation.Over the last one and a half months, quite a lot has happened in the country’s political theatre and a lot will happen over the remaining three phases of polling. A lower voter turnout has rattled the prime minister and his campaign managers, raising a question whether the BJP and its allies can win three-fourths of the Parliament’s 543 seats at stake, as predicted by opinion polls on the back of Modi’s popularity, welfare handouts and the inauguration of the Ram temple. Although a lack of momentum in the first three phases of polling has dampened hopes of a huge majority for the party, still the feeling in the saffron camp is that the BJP is likely to retain power.Political analysts and pollsters sympathetic to the saffron party are of the view that though voting numbers are below expectations, they would not have much impact on the overall results. This is however, contested by many politically neutral analysts. Much of the media punditry and political expertise is on the expected lines — “in any case Modi will win”. But there are many others whose opinion has a caveat — “Modi will win but with a reduced majority”. The problem with this view is that it ignores the quietly simmering anger among voters on livelihood issues. In absence of a national narrative, Modi is confronted with dozens of local issues and societal discontent. That explains why the BJP has been unable to find one encompassing narrative that can resonate across the country.In the ongoing election, Modi’s biggest problem is how to react to the unemployment problem when there are no jobs, how to handle the criticism about stagnant wages and agrarian crisis, and how to woo women voters who are burdened with rising prices. The prime minister’s incoherent election campaign, which has moved from one inane issue to another, has been reduced to an exercise of firing in the dark. Four phases into the seven-phase election, most conventional expectations seem to have been upended and reading of voter sentiment indicates that things are not going the BJP way. However, the election is still a close contest and it is difficult to predict whether anti-incumbency sentiment and voters’ disenchantment with the Modi government will deliver a good number of seats for the INDIA bloc to reach the majority mark.There are two divergent views on the election’s outcome. One, the BJP is most likely to get around 300 seats. Two, BJP is unlikely to get a simple majority and there are doubts whether the NDA will even reach the 272-mark. This means two possibilities: either BJP will repeat its 2019 performance or 2024 will most likely see a repeat of 2004. Election strategist-turned-political activist Prashant Kishor does not see any meaningful decline in BJP’s seat tally. On the other hand, psephologist-turned-political activist Yogendra Yadav sees a decline of at least 50 to 60 seats for the BJP. There is a good chance that Yadav may be right: he has travelled widely in the Hindi belt to arrive at this conclusion. The writer is a senior independent Mumbai-based journalist.

The abrogation of Article 370 in August 2019 marked a historic moment in the history of India, particularly for Jammu and Kashmir (J&K). This move, aimed at integrating the region more closely with the rest of the country, has brought about significant changes and positive developments in various aspects of life in the Kashmir Valley. From a decline in violence to an upsurge in investments, tourism, and job creation, the impact of this decision has been transformative. The abrogation of Article 370 has also paved the way for greater democratic empowerment and political participation in J&K. In the 4th phase of Lok Sabha Elections 2024, Srinagar Lok Sabha constituency had broken all records as the polling percentage went up to 38%, the highest since 1996. The figures for 2019, 2014, 2009, 2004, and 1999 are 14.43%, 25.86%, 25.55%, 18.57% and 11.93% respectively. It is a vote for the hope of a better future. This significant increase in voter turnout reflects the people’s faith and enthusiasm in the democratic process. The peaceful conclusion of the voting process underscores the region’s transition towards a more inclusive and participatory political landscape. This increased political engagement and representation bode well for the region’s democratic future and stability. The abrogation of Article 370 has also catalysed an economic revival in J&K, attracting substantial investments and fostering job creation. Nominal GSDP at current prices of J&K was ₹1.64 lakh crore in FY 2019-20, which increased to ₹2.25 lakh crore for FY 2022-23. In other words, GSDP of J&K had grown with a CAGR of 11.11% in three years (2020-23). The pandemic caused the loss of two out of the three years. Notably, the per capita income in J&K has risen from ₹1.2 lakh in 2019-20 to ₹1.7 lakh in 2022-23. In the past three years, since a new industrial policy was announced in January 2021, J&K has received proposals worth ₹ 84,544 crore in 42 industrial sectors and is expected to create over one lakh new jobs. The region has also seen 44,542 projects assisted under the Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP), leading to an estimated 3,56,336 employment opportunities. There has been a notable revival of tourism in the region and a focus on preserving cultural heritage. The contribution of agriculture to J&K’s GDP decreased from 18.4% in FY21 to 16.9% in FY23, while the share of industry also slightly reduced from 20% to 19.5%. However, the services sector, including tourism, compensated for these declines by increasing from 61.6% to 63.6%. The highest-ever arrival of tourists to Kashmir during 2022 was about 27 lakhs as compared to the previous highest of 13 lakhs in 2016. The government’s efforts to promote cultural festivals and events have helped to revitalise the cultural fabric of J&K, fostering a sense of pride and identity among its residents. There has been a substantial decrease in violence and unrest in J&K. Union home minister Amit Shah revealed staggering statistics, indicating a 70% decline in total terrorism-related cases, an 81% reduction in civilian deaths, and a 48% decrease in the death of security forces since August 2019. This significant improvement in the security situation has instilled a sense of safety and stability among the residents of the region. A government with a strong mandate is better equipped to take decisive action on critical issues that impact the nation’s integrity, security, and socio-economic development. In the case of Article 370, the decision was guided by the vision of fostering unity, equality, and inclusivity across all regions of the country. A strong majority in Parliament enhances the government’s credibility and legitimacy, both domestically and internationally. The success of the abrogation of Article 370 underscores the importance of having a stable and decisive government at the helm. It demonstrates how bold and visionary leadership, backed by a strong mandate, can bring about meaningful change and usher in a new era of progress and prosperity for the nation.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday claimed that the country faced an identity crisis while every citizen's security was under threat during the previous Congress-led government at the Centre. "Earlier, whenever a terrorist incident took place in the country and the world, its links were invariably established with Azamgarh, defaming the district for no fault of its own," he said, adding that those who defamed Azamgarh stand completely exposed today. .live_stock #sr_widget .sr_desc #sr_widget .sr_desc .live_stock .lb-icon The chief minister was addressing a rally in the Lalganj Lok Sabha constituency in Azamgarh in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to seek votes for BJP's Azamgarh candidate Dinesh Lal Yadav Nirahua and Lalganj nominee Neelam Sonkar. Continuing his attack on the opposition, Adityanath said, "The country faced an identity crisis while every individual's security was under threat in the previous Congress governments. Development activities had come to a grinding halt because the Congress-led government was mired in corruption. The poor starved to death while farmers committed suicide as well as daughters and traders were unsafe." He said that the country has witnessed a "changing India" in the last 10 years, with increased global respect, secure borders, and terrorism and Naxalism having been effectively eradicated.

"Azamgarh has transformed into a new symbol of progress within Uttar Pradesh, boasting exceptional four-lane connections to key destinations such as Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Ayodhya, Prayagraj, and various other districts. "Previously, the mention of Azamgarh would elicit shock both nationally and internationally. Back then, residents encountered challenges when travelling domestically or abroad, as even lodging in dharamshalas proved difficult to secure for those hailing from Azamgarh," he said. "However, under the leadership of PM Modi, Azamgarh residents have experienced a notable elevation in respect and have embraced a renewed sense of identity. This transformation is evidenced by the resounding chant of 'Ab ki Baar, 400 Paar' echoing across the nation," he said. Adityanath highlighted the significance of Lord Ram's presence in Ayodhya temple after a 500-year anticipation, which has deeply moved citizens nationwide.

New Delhi, May 16 (UNI) External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Thursday said that India’s bilateral ties with Canada have deteriorated due to Ottawa’s own domestic political interests in giving shelter to pro-Khalistani separatist elements, even as he warned that by giving shelter to “such people who are criminals” Canada will see gang warfare being played out in its territory. Answering questions at an event in Nashik, the EAM said: “Everybody is aware that these days our ties with Canada have deteriorated a little, and the reason for this is due to Canada’s own domestic politics.” He said that “Freedom of speech cannot be freedom to advocate violence, to support separatism, or terrorism in a foreign country. But there is a group of Khalistanis who have misused the freedoms given in Canada -- not just now, they have been doing it for years.” “And in Canada’s politics, these elements are part of vote bank politics, and they are encouraged.” “Today I will state a fact that due to the activities of these people our bilateral relations have deteriorated,” he said, adding that the Indian diplomats face threats hurled at them by Khalistani elements and once a smoke bomb was hurled into the house of the envoy.” The EAM said that whosoever supported separatism against India was “given shelter in that country”. “We feel that Canada’s government and politics should give serious thought to this aspect. We have tried to make them understand about it many times, that even as our ties will deteriorate it is also not in Canada’s interest to give shelter to such people who are criminals – I can’t think of a better word to describe these elements -- as they will bring gang warfare in Canada too.” “So they should understand our case, but due to their internal politics and political interests they have refused to heed us. And there are those who are taking full advantage of this aspect,” he added. His comments come as four Indian nationals have been arrested by Ottawa and charged with murder in the case of the killing of separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada last year. Karan Brar, Kamalpreet Singh, Karanpreet Singh and Amandeep Singh, all in their 20s, have been arrested in connection with the killing of Nijjar. Ties between the two nations have gone on a downward spiral following Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations in September last year of the "potential" involvement of Indian agents in the killing of Nijjar. India has dismissed the charges. UNI RN

In fact, they allowed terrorism and Naxalism and, during their tenure, they refused to accept Lord Ram and ordered firing upon Ram Bhakts,” Yogi Adityanath said. “When the Opposition is not getting support in India, they get statements from Pakistan. They say don’t oppose Pakistan that has an atom bomb. I would ask them: is our atom bomb meant to be kept in the fridge?” Yogi Adityanath said. In his speech, Rajnath Singh said India will be among top three countries in the world as soon as U.P. becomes a trillion-dollar economy. “I never make promises to people but try to fulfill their needs. I challenge the opposition to prove the BJP did not fulfil promises. As our majority government came to power with Narendra Modi as PM, Article 370 was abrogated (in Jammu and Kashmir) just as we had said. Jammu and Kashmir is making progress. Under the Congress, no state was left free of terror activities. In Kashmir now only one or two incidents and nothing more.
